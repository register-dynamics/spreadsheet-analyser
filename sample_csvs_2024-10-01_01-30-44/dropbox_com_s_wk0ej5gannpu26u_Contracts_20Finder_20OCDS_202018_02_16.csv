The Contract will cover all aspects of the academic content required to complete a level 5 qualification. The Contract will be available to all Public-Sector bodies in the UK.
https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations
The Contracting Body will hold a list of Preferred Suppliers. The qualification, and related modules for continuous professional development, will be available for all members of the Government Statistical Service which includes Civil Servants in the main analytical professions and those aspiring to join these. These staff are based across the UK with hubs in Hampshire, London, South Wales, Leeds/Manchester/Sheffield, Glasgow, and Belfast.
Other new continuous professional development courses are proving very popular, with over 40 learners attending the MSc module. Historically, similar courses have attracted 20 or more learners per module. The workforce is transforming and there is a high appetite for training and building capability.
The Contract will commence for the Academic Year 2018/2019 and run for a period of five years. Any student commencing their programme before the Contract expiry will remain with their Preferred Supplier for the duration of their individual programme. Within the Contract students will also be able to access individual modules where they do not wish to complete a full qualification programme, Suppliers may offer different credit accumulator programmes.
Each prospective student and their line manager will have full discretion regarding the selection of a Supplier, based on the location, learning routes, and available optional modules. Suppliers will be required to attend Annual Strategic Review meetings and Quarterly Service Review meetings, where the course content, students' progress, and other issues will be discussed to ensure the contract and available module content remains relevant to the needs of Government and the wider public sector.
In the longer term, the Contracting Body are keen to
a) improve continuity between internal & external courses & programmes;
b) create an integrated knowledge and learning framework which is essentially a continuum of learning from basic through to advanced knowledge;
c) both recognise and reinforce an individual's prior knowledge and skills;
d) grow a framework of Suppliers able, together, to deliver across the UK.
The programme must be ready to run no later than the end of September 2018, with prospective students being able to enroll from April 2018 onwards.",2018-02-16T14:29:56Z,active,CPV,80300000,"Higher education services",CPV,80400000,"Adult and other education services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"British Oversea Territories",,"Channel Islands",Europe,"Isle of Man","Rest of the World","United Kingdom",,300000,GBP,500000,GBP,,"Other - Light Touch Regime",2018-03-09T23:59:59Z,2018-03-20T00:00:00Z,2021-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,,services,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/fec647f5-3db0-4aaf-aee6-120c267f75b7,2018-02-16T14:29:56Z,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"Link to opportunity on our e-tendering tool",https://in-tendhost.co.uk/ons/aspx/ProjectManage/445,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-D303,"Office for National Statistics","Office for National Statistics",GB-GOR,D303,"Government Buildings, Cardiff Road",Newport,"NP10 8XG",Wales,"Amy Jones",Amy.Jones@ons.gov.uk,"01633 456564",https://in-tendhost.co.uk/ons/aspx/ProjectManage/445,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-D303,"Office for National Statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please note that, to register, you must have a valid DUNS number (as provided by Dun and Bradstreet) for the organisation which you are registering, who will be entering into a contract if invited to do so at the Invitation to Tender stage. Potential Providers should note that it could take up to 10 working days to obtain a DUNS number.
Full instructions for registration and use of the system can be found at:
http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/i-am-supplier/respond-tender

Once you have registered on the e-Sourcing Suite, you will need to express your interest by emailing ExpressionOfInterest@Crowncommercial.gov.uk [The dead line for expressing an interest in the Request for Information event is [insert time, day and date (DD/MM/YYYY)]] [Delete if not applicable (ie Open competitions)]

Your email must clearly state:

Aeromagnetic sensor, associated data acquisition system and attitude compensation software

The British Antarctic Survey is seeking to purchase an aeromagnetic sensor, associated data acquisition system and attitude compensation software suitable for operation in an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The platform has an optimal payload of 10kg. For geophysics we aim to operate magnetic and other sensors simultaneously.

The UAV platform will supply the magnetic data acquisition system with DC power (5, 12, or 24V), and optionally a NMEA GPS data stream, 1pps timing pulse, GPS antenna feed, x,y,z data feed from a three axis magnetometer (TFM100-G2), and lidar altimeter data. The platform will be operating in Antarctica from remote field camps for extended missions lasting up to 14 hours. The overall magnetic system must therefore be rugged, reliable and easy to use.

The full detailed specification can be found in the attached RE17237 Aeromagnetic sensor  ITQ Invitation to Quote document.

The Contract will cover all aspects of the academic content required to complete a level 3 qualification. The Contract will be available to all Public-Sector bodies in the UK. 

https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations

The Contracting Body will hold a list of Preferred Suppliers. The qualification, and related modules for continuous professional development, will be available for all members of the Government Statistical Service which includes Civil Servants in the main analytical professions and those aspiring to join these. These staff are based across the UK with hubs in Hampshire, London, South Wales, Leeds/Manchester/Sheffield, Glasgow, and Belfast.
Initially there will be a focus on building capability within the Operational Delivery Profession in the Office for National Statistics, based in Newport, South Wales, and Titchfield, Hampshire, but the areas above are also required.

Other new continuous professional development courses are proving very popular, with over 40 learners attending a  recent MSc module. Historically, similar courses have attracted 20 or more learners per module. The workforce is transforming and there is a high appetite for training and building capability so we anticipate that the demand will grow rapidly with the introduction of more innovative learning solutions.

The Contract will commence for the Academic Year 2018/2019 and run for a period of five years. Any student commencing their programme before the Contract expiry will remain with their Preferred Supplier for the duration of their individual programme. Within the Contract students will also be able to access individual modules where they do not wish to complete a full qualification programme, Suppliers may offer different credit accumulator programmes. 

Each prospective student and their line manager will have full discretion regarding the selection of a Supplier, based on the location, learning routes, and available optional modules. Suppliers will be required to attend Annual Strategic Review meetings and Quarterly Service Review meetings, where the course content, students' progress, and other issues will be discussed to ensure the contract and available module content remains relevant to the needs of Government and the wider public sector.

In the longer term, the Contracting Body are keen to 
a) improve continuity between internal & external courses & programmes; 
b) create an integrated knowledge and learning framework which is essentially a continuum of learning from basic through to advanced knowledge; 
c) both recognise and reinforce an individual's prior knowledge and skills;
d) grow a framework of Suppliers able, together, to deliver across the UK.
 
The programme must be ready to run no later than the end of September 2018

The innovative Region of Readers project is about reading for pleasure and wellbeing and is taking place in geographic areas of regeneration. The project involves six library services in South West England in partnership with Literature Works (the literature development agency for the region), The Reader (a charity running shared reading groups) and SWRLS (the South Western Regional Library Service).  The project aims to support reader development through curated literature resources and engaging communities in shared reading activities, creating cultural content, and cultural events. The project is funded by an Arts Council England grant as part of the Libraries Opportunities for Everyone Innovation Fund programme.

The digital app is one of three main project strands. It will provide people with ways into reading and into the other two project strands, which are the shared reading groups and cultural activities. It will also help promote improved literacy, reading for pleasure and increased digital skills. 

The app builds on the strong track record of the South West Reading Passport, an annual print booklet promoted by South West libraries, featuring a different themed and curated reading list each year.  This year, that content will be delivered in app form for the first time.  
The Region of Readers web pages, currently hosted on the Literature Works website, will sit alongside the app.

We are looking for a fun, accessible and attractive approach to developing our app.  We want it to appeal to the widest possible range of potential readers, rich with interactive content, easy to use and easy for project partners to populate.",2017-12-15T12:54:24Z,complete,CPV,72000000,"IT services: consulting, software development, Internet and support",CPV,72222300,"Information technology services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"South West","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,40000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2018-01-22T23:59:59Z,2018-03-01T00:00:00Z,2021-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-59292,"Bournemouth Borough Council","Bournemouth Borough Council",,,"Bournemouth Borough Council, The Town Hall, Bourne Avenue",Bournemouth,"BH2 6DY","United Kingdom","Alexander Dean",alexanderdean@bournemouth.gov.uk,"+44 1202451465",https://www.bournemouth.gov.uk/Home.aspx,buyer,GB-CFS-79036,"Therapy Box","Therapy Box",,,"3 Sun Studios,

The Government Equalities Office are seeking the development of a guide which aims to share international best practice on equality with regard to protecting against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity or expression and sex characteristics. Although 36 out of 52 Commonwealth member states criminalise homosexuality, there has been progress in some parts of the Commonwealth, such as Nauru, Seychelles and Mozambique decriminalising same sex acts in the last couple of years. But positive achievements go beyond decriminalisation of same sex acts and a number of countries have laws protecting against discrimination in employment, allow organisations working on these issues to register, and/or have other inclusive policies. Celebrating and sharing these positive steps is vital in order to ensure this progress continues. The upcoming Commonwealth Summit presents an opportunity to engage with Commonwealth member states and continue the UK's special responsibility to advance equality across the Commonwealth for people with minority sexual orientations and gender identities.",2018-02-13T17:02:59Z,active,CPV,80000000,"Education and training services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"British Oversea Territories",,"Channel Islands",Europe,"Isle of Man","Rest of the World","United Kingdom",,,,,,open,"Open procedure (below threshold)",2018-03-02T23:59:59Z,2018-03-16T00:00:00Z,2018-04-16T23:59:59+01:00,1,1,services,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/8a436861-bd30-48b6-a9cd-dfada1608230,2018-02-16T11:42:16Z,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"Description and additional information",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/25afaf82-9336-4a4c-95cc-6d15519709ff,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,4,tenderNotice,"Invitation to tender letter",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/35b15ab8-d9b6-4b60-809e-196c95033973,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/QfDr2jb7,"Department For Education","Department For Education",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/QfDr2jb7,"Sanctuary Buildings, Great Smith Street,","London,","SW1P 3BT",England,"Mary Peart",lgbt.tender@geo.gov.uk,,,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/QfDr2jb7,"Department For Education",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Working with six secondary schools, thirty students (plus six reserves) were selected to participate in a challenging programme of personal development culminating in a two-week expedition in Namibia under canvass without luxuries.  The students selected had a variety of barriers to progressing positively at post-16 and had to abide by a strict code of conduct for the entirety of the project. As well as being Ambassadors for the area, along with their families, had to fundraise a significant amount of money to secure a place. The key stakeholders involved included Bolsover Partnership, Hardwick Clinical Commissioning Group, six secondary schools, Raising Aspirations project and a leading expedition provider, all working to ensure the success of the programme. 

To secure their position, students are required to apply, attend interview (parents and carers also interviewed), be provided with a conditional offer, raise £1500 towards the costs, abide by a strict code of conduct, remain fully committed to the project and attend minimum weekly meetings with their in-school lead, pass their risk assessment and attend the mandatory training weekend.  Their position can be lost at any time during this process and further to this the conduct of their wider family can also jeopardise their place. 

Following the initial project in 2014, Namibia Bound 2016 has provided a further 30 students with the opportunity to work in a residential school to deliver lifesaving first aid training to the local community and undertake a trek in the Namib desert.
Due to the impact this is having for communities in Bolsover, we are now aiming for an October 2019 expedition with the project commencing in April 2018.  For further information, please visit http://raisingaspirations.weebly.com/namibia-bound.html

What the WAPapp needs to achieve...

The current passport scheme runs entirely on a paper counterfoil system, with anglers buying books of 10 tokens valued at £3 each. Anything from two to five tokens need to be filled out with personal details and posted in the a letter box at the start of the beat (beatbox) before fishing.A catch return stating the angler's success or lack thereof is then posted at the end of their session.
This allows anglers to decide whether to fish at the last minute and get in the water seconds later. However from the Trust's point of view it requires a large investment of effort to collect, sort and count the 1000s of individual paper tokens and properly account for them at the end of the year. With most WAP funds going directly to the beat owners, the more anglers we host in the Westcountry, the more costly to the trust the current scheme becomes.
The app will therefore:
•	Reduce the workload of WRT staff and volunteers in collection and counting of tokens;
•	Work in partnership with the current paper system;
•	Appeal to and attract the next generation of anglers;
•	Promote the local services and facilities that Cornwall has to offer the visiting angler (It is estimated that each visit by an angler contributes £175 to the local economy through spending on food, accommodation, tackle and transport);
•	Lower the barrier to entry for those new to the eccentricities of river game fishing.

Additional information: Please read the attached Invitation to tender in full before requesting further information or documents.
WRT's procurement policy adheres to the EU Treaty Principles and the National Rules. It also incorporates a number of principles that we believe demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling our charitable objectives and ensuring the fairness and integrity of our procurement practices:
•	Demonstrating 'best value for money'.
•	Environmental considerations.
•	Minimising the risk to WRT in terms of liability.
WRT will make use of an NEC3 Profesional Services Short Contract (PSSC) to best facilitate the responsibilities and duties of us and the successful developer. A break clause will be included in the event that development and deployment of Phase One completion is not met satisfactorily.

Provide accessible, affordable, sustainable and high quality leisure facilities that meet the future needs of residents, enabling them to lead active and healthy lifestyles
One of the key challenges to help achieve the Council's vision is to replace its largest leisure centre, Chiltern Pools in Amersham which is coming to the end of its operational life. The existing operator contract is scheduled to come to an end in March 2020. To identify and address future needs the Council undertook a sports facility and leisure needs assessment in 2015 that highlighted a clear need to replace Chiltern Pools Leisure Centre in order to meet the future needs of Chilterns residents. www.chiltern.gov.uk/background 

The Council has also undertaken a public consultation to gauge residents' appetite for developing a new leisure centre facility. The results demonstrated overwhelming support to take the project forward www.chiltern.gov.uk/consultationresults including bringing the surrounding community facilities (library, nursery and community halls) into one building. The ultimate aim is to create a new state of the art leisure/community hub facility that will serve the needs of residents for the next thirty years and beyond. www.chiltern.gov.uk/chilternpoolsredevelopment   

Looking Forward
Following the completion of the leisure needs assessment and community consultation the Council wishes to move the project forward and is now seeking to appoint a specialist leisure consultant to:
	develop an outcome based leisure operator contract to tender the operation of the current and proposed facilities
	support the procurement process from the point of soft market testing through to the appointment of an operator to deliver the outcome based contract from 1st April 2020

a) creating a publicly available, national dataset  showing the type and location of sites with potential to become significant habitats. This dataset would be able to be integrated into existing information systems, to show where these sites may be. This project would look to recommend ways to keep this dataset up to date in a cost-effective and timely fashion
b) using this information and an analysis of existing policy and delivery initiatives to assess what role there may be for marine planning and marine licensing in either safeguarding these sites or advising applicants of their existence, in relation to individual applications.

This has been highlighted as an issue by stakeholders through marine planning stakeholder engagement and independently is something the marine conservation team had identified as a need. The intended result is to try and improve the environmental policy provision in marine plans and contribute more to environmental protection, whilst helping the economy to flourish.

Leicestershire Police wishes to commission an independent film maker to produce a short film (the working title of which is ""Breck's Last Game"") which will form the centrepiece of a campaign to be launched in Leicestershire (and very probably in other police force areas) in February 2018.
The overall aims of the campaign are to:
•	increase public awareness that teenage boys are just as susceptible to becoming victims of child sexual exploitation and abuse as are teenage girls;
•	encourage greater awareness of the signs that teenage boys may be being abused / exploited; 
•	increase the reporting of offences being committed against teenage boys.
