•	Provide Ofwat with advice and support in preparing merger impact assessments; and

•	Provide Ofwat with technical advice in responding to any CMA process including attending hearings or meetings.

A strong factor for market success, and for the benefits to be delivered, is customer awareness. If customers are sufficiently aware of, and engage with, the opening of the retail market then they can promote effective competition by being actively involved in managing their water retail services. 

The research needs to provide the programme with a clear baseline for the current levels of non-household (business, charities and public sector) customers’ awareness. This should include their understanding of the forthcoming ability to switch supplier and perceived or actual barriers to switching. The research findings will then enable the programme to implement appropriately targeted communications and engagement activities to increase awareness. It will also give us a baseline for post market opening monitoring.

Key Outputs and Deliverables
The Provider is required to deliver the following key outputs:
•	An agreed programme for the research (including scope and timelines)
•	All raw survey data in an agreed format
•	Draft and final reports on questionnaire results
•	Draft and final reports on initial findings, analysis and recommendations from the questionnaire
•	Draft and final detailed report on findings, analysis and recommendations from the focus groups

Timescales
To ensure that effective action can be taken before the market opens, the research needs to be completed by 18 November 2016 with a service start date of 19 September 2016 or earlier. We would expect to see emerging results as and when they are available.

At present, it is anticipated that the engagement will last until autumn 2017 with the drafting of Step 4 Assessment Report. 

The TSC resource engaged will be directed by, and work with, ONR’s GDA C&I assessment team. For efficiency it is expected that they will primarily communicate with ONR C&I staff by teleconference and attending meetings at ONR’s Redgrave Court office in Bootle. However ONR would be prepared to consider flexible location arrangements to accommodate efficiency savings. Attendance at meetings in Japan and other areas in the UK will be required, as needed.

The required resource is two full time equivalent (FTE) professional engineering personnel. Where more than two persons are necessary to provide this resource (e.g. part-time staff), then it is essential that measures are provided to ensure adequate cooperation and coordination between individuals. The main area of work will be the review of C&I safety case documentation and the supporting technical submissions, reporting on findings, and contributing to technical meetings in both the UK and Japan.

ONR is looking for experienced personnel with knowledge of nuclear reactor C&I safety cases to review both Hitachi-GE’s submissions and any independent confirmatory analysis commissioned by ONR. Activities to be delivered as part of this work will include but not be limited to:
•	Review Hitachi-GE’s C&I submissions against ONR’s SAPs, ONR’s technical assessment guides, relevant international standards, and UK/international relevant good practice. 
•	Support ONR (including any required preparation) during teleconferences, videoconferences and / or face-to-face meetings (in the UK and Japan) with Hitachi-GE to discuss progress of the reviews of the various related tasks, findings from the reviews, emerging issues, etc, and / or to request additional information and / or analysis from Hitachi-GE.
•	Draft requests for additional information and / or analysis from Hitachi-GE and advise ONR on the adequacy of the responses.	
•	Provide C&I progress updates to internal ONR meetings where necessary.
•	Assist in the authoring of the Step 4 control and instrumentation Assessment Report, capturing ONR’s assessment of Hitachi-GE submissions and responses to technical questions",,complete,CPV,73000000,"Research and development services and related consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"British Oversea Territories",,,"Channel Islands",Europe,"Isle of Man","Rest of the World","United Kingdom",,,557727,GBP,selective,"Restricted procedure",2016-08-01T23:59:59+01:00,2016-09-12T00:00:00+01:00,2017-12-31T23:59:59Z,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/vpJD4jvD,"Health & Safety Executive","Health & Safety Executive",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/vpJD4jvD,"Redgrave Court, Merton Road",Bootle,"L20 7HS",England,,tenders@hse.gov.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-37329,"Altran UK Ltd","Altran UK Ltd","22 St Lawrence Street

The district is predominantly rural in character, and contains a number of small villages and towns. The largest urban area is the market town of Horsham, situated in the north east of the District.  Horsham District is an appealing place to live, work and visit.  The towns and villages in the District are very attractive, with many historic buildings.  The character of the settlements varies across the District, and each has a unique identity, with different sizes, building types and relationship with the surrounding landscape.  There are a range of building materials seen across the District from tile hanging and flint as well as the particularly distinctive Horsham Stone which is used as a roofing material in a number of towns and villages in the District. 

A full review of the Conservation Areas within Horsham District (except the area within the South Downs National Park) should be undertaken to enable the protection of these areas, which should include appraisals assessing the character of each Conservation Area. The approach to the conservation areas should start afresh, reviewing the current area boundaries and reassessing the areas and identifying the positive and negative elements for inclusion or ‘removal’.  Proposals for the future management of the Conservation Areas should be thoroughly researched, so that these can be consulted upon and adopted by Horsham District Council.

The key objective of the project has been to open a gateway to Europe’s sound and music heritage and to increase its accessibility. In order to meet this objective, work was planned at the start of the project to:
●	Increase the amount of audio content available via Europeana and improve geographical and thematic coverage by aggregating recordings with widespread popular appeal
●	Improve their access by enriching descriptions, developing techniques for cross-media and cross-collection linking
●	Develop audience-specific sound channels that will improve search facility, navigation and user experience
●	Promote the creative reuse of recordings
●	Identify and advocate recommendations on how to resolve domain constraints and improve access to out of commerce audio content, working with music publishers and rights holders
●	Build a network of stakeholders: specialists in technology, rights issues, software development and sound archives. The network will expand to new content-providers and mainstream distribution platforms to ensure the widest possible availability.

The activities of the project are organised within seven thematic work packages: aggregation, enrichment & participation, licensing guidelines, channels development, technical infrastructure, dissemination & networking and project management. 

The project is now nearing the end of its three year lifetime and the project management team would like to commission  an independent evaluation that needs to discover which areas the project has been successful in and where improvements could be made. This evaluation will be shared in confidence solely with the project consortium. Its findings will feed into a final evaluation report to be written by the project management team in December 2016.

The Commissioners are seeking a high quality, safe and affordable solution that promotes prevention, early intervention, building resilience and works in an integrated way with other service areas and families.

WCC is acting as lead commissioner in this process.
These Services may be subject to modifications and changes in order to meet the changing needs and demands of the Council, the CCG’s and the customers. This may also be as the result of additional funding streams and new initiatives. Further details are included in the tender documents.

We are seeking proposals for a service delivery model that will provide a whole emotional well-being and mental health system for 0-25 yr olds within a single contracting solution (either a Prime Contractor or Formal Alliance model).
The procurement process will follow a competitive dialogue process with the aim of enabling the applicants and the Commissioners to combine their knowledge and expertise to develop a solution that can meet the needs of the children and young people of Warwickshire.
This contract may be used to commission any other children’s health/ care services in the future which may include but not limited to: All age neurodevelopmental assessment; Community eating disorder; Speech and language therapy; Physiotherapy; Occupational Therapy; School nursing; Health visiting; Family nurse partnership; Troubled families; Any other children’s health or care service.
Providers will need to demonstrate how their service provision will integrate with existing providers

Applicants should be aware that on award of new contracts, it is possible that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 may apply.
The initial contract term will be 5 years however the Council reserves the right to extend the contract by further periods not exceeding 24 months.
The 0-17yr old budget is approx £5.5m pa.(18-25yr old is TBA during the process)

Coventry City Council and NHS Coventry and Rugby CCG are commissioning a different service provision for the Coventry area. However it is possible that in the future they could commission those services from the contract(s) awarded through this tender process.

We would like to ask supplers, who have experience in this field, what is the most suitable procurement route. The Council wishes to talk to firms to help identify if two stage or single stage Design and Build is the most advantageous procurement route for the Council. In addition we would like to provide information on the forthcoming procurement to build market interest and to garner the views of expert suppliers as to generally the best way to proceed. The Council would like to validate that it has provided or will provide sufficient information to bidders to prevent excessive risk- based pricing. We also wish to consider issues which would assist the client’s team to approach the project works in the most effective manner, having regard to how design and procurement will integrate with the town and country planning process.
