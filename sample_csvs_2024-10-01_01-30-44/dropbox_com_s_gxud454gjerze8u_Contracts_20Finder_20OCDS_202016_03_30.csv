RIVERMEAD LEISURE CENTRE, RICHFIELD AVENENUE, READING

Reading Borough Council is seeking contractors to provide design and build services to construct a demountable swimming facility at Rivermead Leisure Centre, Richfield Avenue, Reading, RG1 8ED. 

An existing swimming pool in the Reading is reaching the end of its viable life and a demountable pool is required by October 2017 as a temporary replacement whilst a permanent solution is sought.

The demountable swimming facility will be an extension to the rear of the existing leisure pool and will be managed by Greenwich Leisure Ltd (GLL) who operates the leisure centre on behalf of the Council.

The proposed layout of the facility is to include:

•	25m*10.5m*1.2m training pool
•	10m*13m*0.9m teaching pool
•	Changing accommodation
•	Associated plant and storage

The Centre is located near the River Thames and was built in 1987 on the site of a disused 1970’s domestic tip. Recent ground investigations have recommended the use of piling as part of the foundation strategy to allow for the floodplain and landfill issues associated with the site.

Currently the scheme is at Feasibility stage and we are looking for contractors who believe they are capable of providing a full design and build service and are interested in carrying out all the associated design and construction works to open a demountable swimming facility by October 2017. The total project value including all design fees, construction and fit-out costs is £1.8million and we are looking for suitable contractors to provide the demountable swimming facility within this financial envelope.

Contractors who believe they are capable of fulfilling these requirements should notify Reading Borough Council of their interest in writing. To register your interest, provide a brief summary of which procurement frameworks you are registered to together with your organisational experience and capability in designing and constructing similar demountable swimming pools. This will be in the form of no more than two sides of A4 (additional PDF attachments will not be read) and sent no later than 5pm on Wednesday 20th April 2016 using the In-Tend e-tendering system

The Council intends to use the information supplied to assess whether suitable contractors exist to meet the Council’s requirements to provide a demountable swimming pool extension at Rivermead Leisure Complex by October 2017. If the Council decides there is sufficient interest from contractors it may decide to proceed with a procurement exercise through further advertisement to formally invite tenders. The Council does not commit to enter into a formal procurement exercise at this stage.

Background:
According to the 2011 ONS census, more than one in five Surrey households (21%) live in a flat, apartment or maisonette. This includes purpose built blocks of flats, converted or shared houses or accommodation in a commercial building (eg over a shop). This equates to nearly 95,000 households. 

Surrey County Council (SCC) is working on behalf of the Surrey Waste Partnership (SWP). The SWP have indentified six key problem areas that are preventing SWP from achieving the requirements of its joint strategy, one of these being hard to reach properties. For the purpose of this project, households including flats, apartments or maisonettes will all be classified under the term hard to reach properties.

Work to tackle the issues of low recycling performance at hard to reach properties has been carried out across Surrey, but the extent of this has varied across the districts and boroughs. A full understanding of the work that has already taken place and of the data and information held by districts and boroughs is needed to inform a programme of work for a future SWP hard to reach properties team.

Aim:
•	Appoint consultants to conduct a scoping exercise that gathers information about hard to reach properties and provides recommendations for future work.
Objectives
•	Carry out desk based data gathering and interviews to collate information from the SWP district and boroughs about their hard to reach properties.
•	Following the information and data gathering, collate and report information on SWP’s hard to reach properties.
•	Identify the high priority sites that need immediate attention.
•	Provide recommendations for future improvement work at Surrey’s hard to reach properties.

Outcome:
This scoping exercise is the first of a three part approach to conducting an inventory of our hard to reach properties and implementing improvements. The information gathered from the exercise will be used to inform the recruitment and work of a specific hard to reach properties team. Following the scoping exercise the newly formed team will use the results of the scoping exercise to:
1.	Build a plan of work and prioritise the most hard to reach properties.
2.	Carry out site surveys for properties to identify improvements that can be made.
3.	Implement tailored service changes and communication improvements.

Timeframe:
SWP are looking for the scoping activity to be completed by the end of June 2016.

(ii)	the impact of older workers on workplace performance to effectively engage with    employers 
The Fuller Working Lives Background Evidence Review considered a number of data sources (including the Labour Force Survey) and a wide range of external research pieces to bring together the current evidence base related to older workers.  The evidence base is largely descriptive and focuses on the reasons that older workers fall out of the labour market and the barriers they face in regaining employment.  There are clear gaps around ‘what works’ to keep older workers in work and the benefits to employers in retaining and recruiting older workers. 
Understanding these questions should bring a step change to the evidence base for Fuller Working Lives (FWL). In particular this research should enhance the evidence on the role of employers and impacts of older workers and has great potential to inform policy direction in this area to improve productivity and contribute to full employment.",,complete,CPV,73000000,"Research and development services and related consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,,"British Oversea Territories","Channel Islands",Europe,"Isle of Man","Rest of the World","United Kingdom",,,49220,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2015-12-22T23:59:59Z,,2016-03-21T00:00:00Z,2016-06-30T23:59:59+01:00,1,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-supplierregistration.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/6sQD8uds,"Crown Commercial Service","Crown Commercial Service",GB-SRS,supplierregistration.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/6sQD8uds,"Concept House",Newport,"NP10 8QQ",Wales,"David Hughes",ServiceOps.research@crowncommercial.gov.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-24300,"National Institute of Economic & Social Reserach","National Institute of Economic & Social Reserach","2 Dean Trench Street

The provider will be expected to support a cohort of the 600 clients that are active on the programme, providing specialist dietetic support, in order to help the clients achieve their weight loss goals. They will be expected to work with the client over a series of appointments setting personalised goals, advising on diet changes and using behaviour change skills to maximise the effectiveness of their input.

 To deliver the following objectives:
 
a) To produce a methodology to determine the extent to which HLS has (a) delivered an improvement in lowland heathland condition; (b) been appropriately targeted. This will be achieved by using a combination of field survey, and comparison with earlier survey material. 
b) To use the developed methodology on an appropriate sample of HLS agreements on lowland heathlands to assess the most common management options (grazing, cutting, burning and chemical control of bracken/scrub), with particular focus on grazing, and evaluate their success in terms of progress towards, or achievement of Favourable Condition (FC) for the habitat by comparing them with the condition pre-agreement. The sample should ideally include a counterfactual element, to assess management approaches taken without HLS agreement;
 c) To assess (i) how changes in the attributes and (ii) features required to achieve FC impact on the associated species (e.g. the provision of bare ground results in more populations of solitary wasps).
 d) To evaluate the overall effectiveness of the HLS scheme thus far for Lowland Heathlands, using the outputs from objectives a, b and c, noting individual successful and unsuccessful interventions and the reasons for them.

Community services are intended as an alternative to hospital-based outpatient services where non-complex acute and chronic conditions can be seen for clinical assessment, diagnostics and treatment in a community setting. This is in line with GWCCG’s strategic commissioning intentions  to ensure that high quality care is delivered as close to the patient’s home as is appropriate. 
GWCCG has a clear vision for the development of a comprehensive and fully integrated model of health and care provision to our local population. Central to this vision is the development of excellent integrated community services, working under the leadership of Primary Care to provide a holistic health and care response genuinely tailored to the needs of a specific individual. Our new model of care, which will continue to evolve from 2017 onwards, focuses on the creation of an organised, coordinated and effective out of hospital provider environment that is seen as the main conduit for meeting a person’s health and care needs. 
Through this procurement process, NHS Guildford and Waverley CCG is seeking a provider to deliver ‘out of hospital’ services that will work with the CCG and other key partners to deliver the highest quality healthcare for the population of Guildford and Waverley.
As the NHS continues through the process of change, GWCCG wish to work with providers who have the capability to embrace change and continually support and motivate their workforce towards innovative service delivery. The transformation of our community services is a key step in achieving this model of care. 
Historically, community services have been provided by a large number of fragmented and separate teams across the primary, acute, community and social sectors. It is our ambition to move away from this paradigm by instead creating integrated community health and care services that are capable of delivering a flexible and wide ranging service response based on clinical need, whenever it is required.
GW CCG is holding a bidder briefing event on 13 April 2016. Details of how to register to attend are attached to this notice.
