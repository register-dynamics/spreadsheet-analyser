Out-of-autoclave (OoA) manufacturing has established itself as a way to process next-generation composite structures, and is seen to be a crucial area for development. In this context, the NCC has identified a need to procure a suite of equipment, to provide a Large Scale Capability to directly support key Aerospace and other sectors such as Automotive, Marine and Oil and Gas research and development programs. This procurement is for a composite curing oven capable of producing aero structures up to 20 metres in length to directly support key manufacturing research and development programs.
The capability shall be specified, procured and commissioned to ensure suitability for industrial research and development programs as well as supporting maturation of emerging manufacturing technologies from academia toward industrial application. 

The NCC is seeking to procure a turnkey solution for a Large Scale Oven capable of curing and supporting the infusion of composite components of up to circa 20m x 5m x 2.5m. Temperature range from 40°C to 250°C, with integrated vacuum system and a comprehensive data acquisition capability.

        Swindon Borough Council is seeking to appoint a service provider for each of the two zones Swindon North - Lot 1 and Swindon South - Lot 2 who will coordinate, manage and deliver (both directly and indirectly) domiciliary care and community support services. The successful providers will be required to transition the provision of the services to service users from a traditional time/task service model to an outcomes-based service model with the aspiration of providing the services on the basis of an agreed Capitated Budget. The Council will also consider a sole Provider (Lot 3) to provide services for the whole of Swindon, however, the Provider will need to demonstrate they are exceptional.  The term of the Contract will be 10 years subject to contract reviews at years 3, 5 and 8 where the Parties will have the option to make changes to the Contract or terminate the arrangements.

      The GD was launched in January 2013 as a framework under which consumers could take out 'pay as you save' loans for energy efficiency and microgeneration measures installed on their property. These loans are repaid over the lifetime of the measure through the electricity bill. Responsibility for the loan repayments passes to future occupiers of the property. 
      The OIS ensures an independent customer redress process is available when something goes wrong with a GD Plan and is an essential element of the customer redress landscape for the GD market.",,complete,CPV,79419000,"Evaluation consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"British Oversea Territories",,,"Channel Islands",Europe,"Isle of Man","Rest of the World","United Kingdom",,,,330,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2017-05-24T23:59:59+01:00,2017-06-14T00:00:00+01:00,2019-06-13T23:59:59+01:00,1,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-49166,"Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS)","Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy (BEIS)","Second Floor, Area D, 3 Whitehall Place",London,"SW1A 2AW",UK,,GDProcurement@beis.gov.uk,+443000688062,,buyer,GB-CFS-62643,"The Ombudsman Services Limited","The Ombudsman Services Limited","Brew House,
