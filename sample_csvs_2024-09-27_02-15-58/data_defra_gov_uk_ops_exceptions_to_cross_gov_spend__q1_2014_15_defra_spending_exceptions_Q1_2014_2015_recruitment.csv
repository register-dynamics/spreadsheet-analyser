Rural Payments Agency,"RPA have been given approval for up to 100 FTE to cover us through the CAP implementation period. As yet we have only taken in a small number of people under that approval. Therefore further grades, length of service etc are still to be determined. We are therefore unable to be specific about salary and expenditure.This reflects our flexible/agile approach to resourcing that sees us permanently resource to a level below our peak business demand and then use flexible resourcing (including temps/FTA/interims) for time limited periods to address the gaps etc. This is important context and a deliberate part of the resourcing strategy.
