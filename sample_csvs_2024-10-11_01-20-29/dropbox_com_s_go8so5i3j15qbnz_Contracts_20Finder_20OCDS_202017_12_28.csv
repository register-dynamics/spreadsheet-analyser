The programme will implement and establish the principles of QI methodology. The strategicpartner will have a proven track record in developing sustained cultures of continuous QI in healthcare withdemonstrable outcomes.
Translating QI into healthcare carries greater complexity than perhaps any other service or productionenvironment. The range of services provided, facilities, people involved and patient and clinical needvariability all combine to impact on the opportunity for waste and interrupted flows. This is exacerbated by thegeographical spread of our services.
With patient safety paramount, the need to provide any change programme within a clinically safe and effectiveenvironment is essential. QI methods are expected to not only reduce waste and flow variability but to alsoimprove quality as errors and unnecessary variance are removed and time/resources are made available toprovide safer, better services. It is essential that stakeholders clearly understand that this programme is aboutQI rather than being financially-driven, though we expect to identify opportunities for productivity and efficiencyopportunities as a by-product.
We have a number of improvement ambitions, which we would expect the programme to help us deliver in thelong term:
â¢ Move our CQC rating from Requires Improvement to Outstanding
â¢ Fully empowered and engaged workforce
â¢ Devolved decision making and accountability
â¢ Teams as the building block for everything rather than professions and functions
â¢ Alignment of strategic change initiatives
â¢ Sustainable productivity and efficiency opportunities
â¢ Slick and aligned management and governance processes
The programme will:
â¢ Undertake an assessment of QI readiness
â¢ Develop and embed QI techniques and processes into BSMHFT

Similar obligations exist for the production of an annual inventory of ammonia emissions under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. This project will help the Authority meet these obligations. Estimates of agricultural emissions are prepared for the Authority and shared with BEIS as part of the overall emissions reporting for the whole UK economy. Contractor(s) will work closely with the Authority, BEIS, Ricardo Energy & Environment, and the UK's Inventory Agency to ensure delivery of the Project.

 This project will deliver the annual inventories of ammonia and GHGs to the Authority on a timely basis as detailed in Section 4 of this specification. The project will also deliver annually updates projections of emissions. The project will compile the GHG using the UKs country specific agricultural inventory model approach developed under the GHG R&D Platform. Emissions estimates will be generated using the inventory calculations model developed under project SCF0102. Annual estimates of ammonia emissions will be produced from the same model. Details of the model are available from the authority on request.

HSE's allergen monitoring service currently uses a 8 year old Tecan Evo system, with fixed pipetting probes.  This is used primarily to measure by immunoassay low levels of allergens that have been extracted from filters after air sampling. The automated immunassay system is also used in the development of immunoassays. Overall the automation has a medium workload, and would be in use on a daily basis. 

We are looking to replace the current Tecan Evo instrument.  We are looking for a system that can be used by staff who do not have considerable technical knowledge of the equipment and programming software, and will allow us to reduce maintenance expenditure in the future. We understand that the use of dispoable pipettes will incurr increased consumable exposure, but we have some methods where the ability to ensure zero carry-over between samples is necessary.

The detailed requirements are defined in the Specification, but please see below summary for each Lot.

LOT 1: Structured Treatment Service for adults and young people in Northamptonshire will include prescribing, OST, psychosocial interventions and responsibility for the management of the residential rehab, inpatient and ambulatory detox, shared care with GP surgeries, needle exchange, supervised consumption with pharmacies, the distribution of naloxone and foil. It will also introduce an integral mental health service capable of meeting the needs of Northamptonshire clients; provide structured treatment for young people allowing them access to the specialist resources as needed and house the re-designed single point of contact (SPOC) representing all services.
LOT 2: Recovery Service for all treatment and recovery clients in Northamptonshire will be peer based and provide an interface with structured treatment. It will host mutual treatment options and include the management of the PHaSE housing project. 
LOT 3: Specialised Training Service, providing training on drug and alcohol awareness for substance misuse services for older people aged 45 and over.
LOT 4: Young People's Early Intervention Service - Services for young people with or living with problematic substance misuse will be divided into two. Those who require structured treatment (those with moderate to severe addictions) will be managed in the community by the Early Intervention service (Lot 4) with structured treatment drawn down from the all-through service (see fig.1). This configuration takes account of best practice, ensures that those who need treatment can access the best available with the interventions taking place within the young person's community environment. The Early Intervention service will comprise the larger part and will have workers embedded in clusters (schools or Early Intervention) where they will devise an appropriate prevention agenda for young people. It will support local services in the earlier identification of young people, at risk of, or substance abusing. It will provide assessment of the severity of the problem and steer the young person towards less harmful behaviours. Where the young person requires a more intensive treatment the community based early intervention service will draw down the practitioner and resources from the treatment service (Lot 1).

The service will be required from 1st April 2018 for an initial period of 4 years (up to 31st March 2022) with Lots 1, 2 and 4 having an option to extend for a further period of up to 4 years. The Authority believes that TUPE does apply to all Lots at its commencement.

Our collections, our people and our partnerships enable us to make an invaluable and highly relevant contribution to some of the biggest issues facing the global population. We do this through research, conservation, training and inspiring others about the importance of plant and fungal science.

We have existing partnerships to deliver an MSc programme, diplomas and short courses. We recognise however that we may be able to optimise even further our offer in line with the current scientific research mission, and as a result RBG Kew's Executive Board wish to explore the opportunity to create a ""Kew University"". 

We are considering seeking professional assistance to produce a Full Business Case from which the Executive Board of RBG Kew can take a decision, in principle, about whether to proceed with the concept of a Kew University.

To this end we will be carrying out a soft market testing exercise, the aims of which include but are not limited to: 

â¢             Testing the clarity of our stated requirements;
â¢             Establishing if the market has experience of being involved in delivering similar projects; and
â¢             Ascertaining if there is an appetite within the market to tender for the delivery of these services

We are looking to test this proposition with Consultancies who have worked extensively in the Higher Education Sector, has the demonstrable experience, and is qualified to deliver a project of this complexity.  

If you would be interested in participating in this Soft Market Testing exercise you will be required to review our draft specification and respond to a short questionnaire.  We will also be hosting a Supplier Engagement Day on 10th July 2017.
