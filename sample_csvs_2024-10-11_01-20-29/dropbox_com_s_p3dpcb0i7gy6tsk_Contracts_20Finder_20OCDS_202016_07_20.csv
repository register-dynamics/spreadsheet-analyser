Staff work at various locations throughout Surrey as well as in Kingston-upon-Thames. 

The council is divided into seven directorates, Adult Social Care and Public Health; Children, Schools and Families; Deputy Chief Executive’s Office, Communities; Finance; Legal, Democratic and Cultural Services and Environment and Infrastructure.   

We are looking for a provider to deliver a one day coaching course. We would like the following content to be included within the course:

•	Outline of what a coach is (e.g difference from mentor/manager/counsellor) and what skills are required to coach.
•	Importance of ethics in coaching – when it is appropriate to use it, when to make referrals to other authorities, contracts between coach and coachee and confidentiality.
•	Coaching models (GROW model, coaching cycle and Skill/Will matrix) and their practical applications in a coaching session.
•	Opportunity to have a practical space to try out coaching/conduct a practice session.

As the duration for each course will be one day we would like providers to suggest appropriate ideas for pre and post course support (e.g workbooks, post course resources) that you can provide to help embed the learning from the course. 

Please propose any other relevant subject matter and content you think will enhance course delivery. The programmes should be able to offer a blended learning approach, involving a mixture of both theory and practice where applicable. 

Training is a priority to the Council to help its staff develop the skills and competencies to face any challenge we may encounter.  The contract will cover coaching training needs across the county and provision of courses will be dependant on the demand, funding available and availability of venues.

All suppliers must ensure that they keep up to date with all changes in legislation, County Policy and Regulatory Bodies and that these changes are reflected in the training courses delivered and a visible audit trail can be provided / shown of how this is achieved.
Successful providers will be expected to deliver the programmes at various locations within the county of Surrey and the borough of Kingston Upon Thames. 

Venues are chosen on a “fit for purpose/cost effective” basis and as facilities vary providers will be required to supply their own presentation equipment e.g. laptops/ projectors.   We may also seek to deliver courses out of normal office working hours to suit the needs of some of our delegates. If the contract is accessed by any of our other public sector partners the locations will depend on which of our partners join the contract.  It is therefore envisaged that the locations could be anywhere in the South East during the lifetime of this contract.

Stage 1 - Carry out a conditional survey of each mast including all fixings, connections, guys ropes and anchorage point and then report on the suitability of the masts in their current condition.
Stage 2 - Disconnect top antenna wires running between all three masts. This work must be undertaken by a competent nominated antenna contractor. The removal of the antenna wires shall allow NLB Staff to undertake tuning tests to establish whether the station can be run using only the central mast.

The outcome of the works at this stage shall determine the scope and timescales for further works, there are three possible options as listed:
Option 1
Should the trials prove unsuccessful the antenna wires shall be re-connected and then stage 3a of the works shall be implemented. 
Option 2
Should the trials show a strong indication that using only the central mast will be successful the refurbishment/demolition works shall be delayed for 4 weeks to allow NLB personnel to monitor the results. After this period Stage 3b of the works will be implemented as advised by NLB Rep.
Option 3
Should the trials prove inconclusive the NLB retain the option to extend the trial period to 6 months after which time the works will move on to either stage 3a or 3b as determined by NLB Rep.
All tenderers should take note of the above and price in accordance particularly in relation to mobilisation of site.
Stage 3a - Refurbishment of all three masts as detailed in the Bill of Quantities.
Stage 3b - Refurbishment of the central mast only with the outer masts being taken down and removed from site as outline in the Bill of Quantities. 
Stage 4 - Demobilisation and site clearance

Site visits will be conducted on Wednesday 3 August 2016 for this project.  Please contact Ruth Millan, Procurement@nlb.org.uk to confirm attendance.

It is the recent growth and propagation path of the crack that has caused this situation to arise and given rise to the concern that action must be taken now to move the station. Whilst significant resources are being expended to refine the time estimates, the process of ice flow prediction is subject to errors and so accurate prediction is difficult. Given the risks articulated above, it is considered prudent to proceed on the basis that the main modules must be moved within the two year timeframe currently given

Even allowing for the best planning, there is still a large element of contingency that must be built in, as factors such as the weather can have a profound but unpredictable impact on schedules. In order to move the station work must be conducted simultaneously in two locations – the current site (dismantling) and the new position (building the associated infrastructure). The work is complex, highly specialised and extremely challenging, often pushing people, equipment and processes to the limit. The work will involve approximately 100 people on site and a large support team in the UK. The fact that BAS, in conjunction with its partners, was able to build Halley VI without a single time loss accident is testament to the professionalism of the team that plans executes such operations. It is the same team that have provided the advice in this note.


The planning for second phase of the work is now underway, in order to secure the safety of the people, station and associated facilities, work must continue In Antarctica this summer season i.e. November 2016 and materials must be shipped by September 2016. 

To be able to make that shipping deadline, orders to procure the equipment required must be placed as soon as possible. Should those delivery deadlines be missed it will not be possible to ship the equipment to Antarctica this season. As a result, work will be delayed by at least one year and it will not be possible to relocate the station in the timescale explained.",,complete,CPV,44165000,"Hoses, risers and sleeves",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"CB3 0ET","East of England","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other - ",2016-06-24T23:59:59+01:00,2016-06-24T00:00:00+01:00,2016-07-24T23:59:59+01:00,,,goods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED","UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"North Star House, North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,FMProcurement@uksbs.co.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-32557,"Arco Limited","Arco Limited","PO Box 21

It is anticipated that the tender documents will be issued at the end of August 2016. Suppliers can express an interest in the opportunity through the Council’s eTendering website; www.supplyingthesouthwest.org.uk .

Bournemouth Borough Council and the Borough of Poole “The Councils” have since 2014 jointly commissioned a Rough Sleeper Outreach Service to meet the needs of their respective rough sleeper populations. The Councils wish to continue to jointly commission an assertive outreach service for rough sleepers to cover both boroughs.

The scope of the contract is to provide an assertive outreach service to support rough sleepers across both Bournemouth and Poole, working with individuals to address needs and access accommodation. This service includes severe weather emergency provision along with the provision of a drop in / day centre in both Local Authority areas.

Service requirements include 365 days a year availability and an outreach service that follows the assertive engagement model. The supplier will be required to address the housing and related support needs of individuals and implement the reconnections policies in each area, working with various partners as required.

The aim of the Bournemouth and Poole Rough Sleeper Team (BPRST) is to reduce rough sleeping as close to zero as possible across both Council Local Authority areas.  The service delivered must be responsive and seek to quickly help rough sleepers into appropriate accommodation and assist individuals to access relevant support services in order to avoid repeat homelessness.

The contract will commence on 1 April 2017. TUPE will apply to this contract and will need to be considered when the tender documents are released. 

The forecast contract value for this opportunity is between £268,000 and £350,000 per annum as it is dependent on the funding available to the local authority for the service.
