This may be because of finding it difficult to get work that pays enough to cover day-to-day essentials and to secure decent housing. Some people feel excluded or unable to access local facilities, and some of our citizens may be less able to maintain good health, through no fault of their own, and need support to stay well. 
      
      Outcomes funded through Narrowing the Gap II are broadly in two categories. 
      
      a) Outcomes which contribute to maintaining thriving communities; a vibrant third sector; tackling poverty; and supporting cohesion and integration. These will be achieved through services which potentially benefit the whole population, although some are targeted at particular population groups.
      
      b) Outcomes which positively promote the preventative health and care agenda, i.e. supporting independence, re-enablement and wellbeing with the aim of managing demand for longer-term support. The services we aim to fund in this area are intended to benefit residents with identified health needs, or current or emerging care and support needs. This includes younger and older adults with physical disabilities, learning disabilities, long term health conditions or substance misuse issues, all older people and all adult unpaid carers.
      
      Narrowing the Gap II is a key component of our response to the changing needs of our residents. We need to plan and cater for increasing demands for some services, whilst other services will need to continue to change so that the local authority is sustainable and able to meet its statutory duties with significantly less funding from central government.

The project will facilitate better understanding of technology learning rates in selected renewable technologies and hence allow better prediction the long-term cost reduction potential in the renewable sector. Specific outcomes will be improved predictions for load factors beyond 2020, which will enable identification of potential implications to policy. In particular, it has been noted that as the cost of renewable technology decreases there could be a tendency for over-planting the amount of renewables for a given grid connection and so artificially increasing load factors.

UoL currently use WPM who provide a number of different pathways including an online shop for products, events and short-courses, integration into our Library System (Capita Chorus) to allow the payment of library fines, integration into our accommodation system (Occam - Room Service) to allow the payment of accommodation fees via recurring card payments. Recurring card payments are also taken for tuition fees and other items.  There is also a payment pathway to allow invoice payments. Student payments and invoice payments contain validation against student number / invoice number. 

UoL is also interested in allowing payments by direct debit, which we would envisage replacing recurring card payments. 

Last year 21,000 transactions were processed  with an income of £14.8 million.

UoL has existing agreements with a Payment Services Provider (Realex) and Card Acquirer (Global Payments) which ideally we intend to maintain.

If your organisation can provide something that can meet our requirements please email Matthew Hird mhird@lincoln.ac.uk, with a brief outline of your organisation and solution.

The type of organisation that we would look to work with would have a fully developed product, experience and track record of proving payment gateway solutions, reference sites and be able to evidence PCI compliance.",,cancelled,CPV,48219100,"Gateway software package",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"LN6 7TS",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Z6sk4ppe,"University of Lincoln","University of Lincoln",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Z6sk4ppe,"Univeristy of Lincoln, Brayford Pool",Lincoln,"LN6 7TS",England,"Matt Hird",mhird@lincoln.ac.uk,"01522 88 6612",http://www.lincoln.ac.uk,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/Z6sk4ppe,"University of Lincoln",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Various options are available, ranging from keeping the current EU approach to considering adopting alternative models (or parts thereof) used in other third countries. 

 The central aim of this project is to scope out the differences in national organic regulations between the UK, EU, EEA countries, the recognised third countries/equivalence models and other third countries or models of interest, highlighting the key strengths and weakness in order to provide an evidence base for future UK policy direction. The value of a UK specific organic label should also be investigated.

We emphasise equality and diversity and the principles of inclusivity in all our work.  Ways in which barriers to participation can be overcome and consideration of under-represented groups should be threaded throughout any tender response.
The number of learners studying towards Functional Skills maths and English qualifications has reduced significantly over the last 2 to 3 years due to the focus on GCSE.  However, these qualifications remain popular with adults and for some 16-19 learners with lower grades at GCSE.
The revised subject content for Functional Skills includes using phonics to teach learners at entry levels. The level of knowledge and the application of any particular system of phonics currently used in the Further Education sector is not fully known. There is an array of different schemes for teaching phonics for young children and DfE offers information and guidance to help schools select an effective phonics programme.  However, using phonics strategies for adults is under-researched.  Maxine Burton in Phonetics for Phonics: underpinning knowledge for adult literacy practitioners: NIACE 2009 says, ""There are no clear guidelines as to how to set about using phonics systematically with adults.""  Her book aims to provide underpinning knowledge on phonics to enable teachers to adapt existing phonics schemes for children to be effective with their learners. She also states that, ""phonics instruction needs to be systematic, not half-hearted or ad hoc to be successful'.

The NHS cervical screening programmes have been successful in reducing both the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in women in the UK.
The Isle of Man cannot provide this service due to the fact that the health services on the Isle of Man only perform approximately 6,500 smears from GP's and colposcopy services, which is not enough to comply with national cancer screening data of 35,000 samples per annum (NHS England).
There is a code of practice for cytology laboratories participating in the UK cervical screening programme (October 2015 v2). This has a pivotal part in outlining the key principals, the organisation and staffing, screening and reporting, IT, failsafe, quality assurance, storage and retention of data and samples and training and education.
The Department of Health and Social Care, a Department of the Isle of Man Government (the Department) therefore invites expressions of interest from appropriately experienced and established cytology departments in the UK complying with this code of practice.
For the Department to accept an Expression of Interest, potential applicants must be able to provide a service which fulfils the following requirements:
- Be an accredited laboratory either CPA or UKAS ISO15189 (2012).
- Screen all Cervical Cytology specimens from the Isle of Man by HPC registered Biomedical Scientists/Consultant HPCP...ts of HPV testing.
- The successful applicant will be responsible to run a failsafe protocol in line with the National Health Service Cervical Screening programme for all screened patients.
Notwithstanding that these requirements are subject to the laws of the Isle of Man Government; both parties agree to comply with any applicable provision under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Data Protection Act 1998 both Acts of Parliament.
Should you wish to participate in this competitive exercise please register your organisation on the Isle of Man Government's Procurement Portal at the following website https://in-tendhost.co.uk/iomg/aspx/Home. Please select 'Register' from the menu on the left side of the Home Page.

Once you have expressed an interest, the 'Form of Acknowledgement' document will become available to complete.  In order to progress to the next stage you will need to download, sign and upload the completed 'Form of Acknowledgement' document before the Expression of Interest deadline detailed below.

-	undertake a desk-based study to collate existing information about bat distribution and activity levels and important habitat features in summer roosting and foraging areas to identify Priority Bat Areas within the Ryevitalise Landscape Partnership scheme area.
-	develop a detailed methodology to carry out a bat survey across the Bat Priority Areas within the scheme area in order to provide base line data for the project on distribution and activity levels for all bat species at summer habitats, ensuring that this uses robust and repeatable methods and protocols.
-	undertake bat surveys in the 2018 survey season following the agreed methodology.
-	In addition, surveyors will be required to record on site issues, provide suggestions for improved management for the benefit of bats, and raise awareness of bats with land managers where appropriate.
The second purpose of the brief is for the appointed consultant to undertake a survey to confirm the distribution and status of the Alcathoe bat within the Ryevitalise Project area and to understand this species' ecology. This would include recommendations to inform practical conservation actions at key sites for this species (this work can of course be incorporated into the point above).
We also require suggestions on further research that would assist the development of a conservation strategy. It is also expected that the appointed consultant will suggest how their methods and protocols could be adapted to make them suitable for citizen science, to be used in future monitoring during the delivery phase of the Ryevitalise scheme.",2017-12-06T11:24:35Z,active,CPV,90721700,"Endangered species protection services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"Yorkshire and the Humber","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7500,GBP,open,"Open procedure (below threshold)",2018-01-05T23:59:59Z,,2018-01-29T00:00:00Z,2018-08-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,1,services,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/2b0f8727-6e2b-4c7c-be1a-212f39f84b16,2017-12-06T11:24:35Z,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"NOTE: To register your interest in this notice and obtain any additional information please visit the myTenders Web Site at the link provided.",http://www.mytenders.org/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=DEC149252,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-58603,"North York Moors National Park Authority","North York Moors National Park Authority",,,"The Old Vicarage, Bondgate",Helmsley,"YO62 5BP",England,"Alex Cripps",a.cripps@northyorkmoors.org.uk,"+44 1439770657",http://www.northyorkmoors.org.uk,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-58603,"North York Moors National Park Authority",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a burgeoning food and drink culture emerging in the area, which is in turn generating further destination footfall.

The performance of what was envisioned as a temporary operation has led Hull 2017 to extend the operation of HSG for a further three-year period with a view to it becoming a permanent, and prominent, cultural venue in Hull.  

The café and bar occupy the front part of the ground floor gallery and there is also a rooftop bar which is open seasonally and is weather dependent.  The food and beverage operation is intrinsic to the on-going success of HSG, as the primary means of generating revenue to both support the gallery operation and drive non-traditional gallery audiences to the venue.
