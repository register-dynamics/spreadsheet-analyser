The Council wishes to understand the capacity within the urban areas of the Borough for housing development. The Study will be used to inform the new plan, assist in identifying sites and the amount of greenfield land that may be needed to meet the Borough's housing requirements to 2036.
The study should seek to identify opportunities for providing new dwellings on previously developed land and buildings within settlements. The evidence will provide expert advice to:
• understand the development potential for housing within the urban areas;
• assist in ensuring that housing on previously developed land is maximised in sustainable locations; and
• establish whether there will be a need to release greenfield sites to meet the housing requirements in the Borough. 
The consultants should set out a methodology which will provide the intended advice and evidence for this commission and meet the study's objectives.

We need to know what technologies and/or services might be suitable, together with indicative costs of the system, its implementation, support and maintenance. The Library is therefore inviting potential vendors to provide information on the potential options available for provision of components of the proposed Collection Management Solution.
We invite vendors responding to this RFI to provide as much information relating to the requirements specified as they see fit, on the understanding that no single system may fulfil all of them.

This in conjunction with the increased demands from TMBC applications and systems requiring access to storage and a requirement for the provision of DR meant a review of our current infrastructure was appropriate. Demand for increased capacity on the Council's storage infrastructure will continue to rise over the coming 5 year period. This is due to new systems and functionality coming online, co-location and joint working with Health colleagues. The key objective of this tender is to provide the infrastructure required to provide adequate storage capacity for the next 5 years with the ability to implement DR. A fundamental review of our current storage infrastructure and requirements has been completed and an exercise has already been undertaken to identify the storage infrastructure required to support future demands. Consequently the council will not consider responses which propose other brands or solutions other than those identified in the tender.

UKAEA is managing the delivery of the Active Cells remote handling facility as part of the UK contribution to the European Spallation Source (ESS) in Sweden. The purpose of the facility is to process and store spent radiologically activated target station components.
 Work on handling processes and in-cell equipment/facilities are progressing towards the detailed design phase. For individual processes and items of equipment, options need to be identified, assessed against the requirements, and developed towards a suitable design ready for manufacture.
 This market enquiry relates to the 4-Axis Milling Station that will be situated inside the Process Cell (PC). The Milling Station will allow for the recovery and subsequent processing of containers of exotic materials that are contained within 2 of the activated components.
 The Milling Station will be operated remotely without local manual intervention. The use of fluids in the for coolant and in any hydraulic actuation or clamping will not be allowed, although lubrication in gearboxes, etc. is permissible.
 The first component is a sealed 6 000 kg, 2 500 mm diameter stainless steel disk that contains 36 stainless steel cassettes each containing a set of tungsten bricks. Each cassette weighs approximately 100 kg and is designed to be removed radially once the rim of the disk has been machined off.
 The second component is a 3 500 kg steel block approximately 620 mm high, 1 200 mm wide and 1 350 mm long. This block consists of a base plate and 2 top sections that are sealed over the top of a 150 kg container of beryllium by a set of stitch welds. The beryllium container can be removed when the stitch welds have been machined off.
 Optional additional scope would include a robotic handling system that can support cut sections and lift the material containers free of the main components once freed.
 The solution will require design, manufacture and installation into the Active Cells facility. This PIN has been published to enable market research to commence to assess the reaction of the market to the requirement and to review available technologies. UKAEA will conduct a dialogue with the marketplace and this may result in a call for competition based on the scope of the requirement developed through the dialogue.",,planning,CPV,42623000,"Milling machines",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,OX143DB,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-PB137,"UK ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY","UK ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY",GB-GOR,PB137,"Culham Science Centre",Abingdon,OX143DB,England,"James Phillpott",james.phillpott@ukaea.uk,"01235 466904",,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-PB137,"UK ATOMIC ENERGY AUTHORITY",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This Framework is designed to meet the needs of YPO by establishing an agreement for providers to deliver stock into YPO's distribution centre in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.   
The Framework Agreement will cover the period from 1st October 2017 to the 30th September 2019, with two options to extend to for an additional 12 months (subject to an annual review, incorporating price negotiations and KPI performance.)
The first decision to extend the contract period will be taken by the end of August 2019 and will be dependent on satisfactory completion of all aspects of the contract to date, the current market conditions for this category and YPO's contracting structures.  The maximum contract period will therefore be 4 years, from 1st October 2017 to 30th September 2021 (subject to an annual review, incorporating price negotiations and KPI performance).
The framework has an estimated value of between £3 and £5 Million for the maximum life of the contract (4 years).  All references in these documents to values and/or volumes of business are for guidance only and there is no guarantee of any business.

We are one of the leading 'arm's length management organisations' (ALMOs) in the country. 
      
      SCH's responsibilities include the management and maintenance of the Council's housing stock, which includes approximately 92 temporary accommodation properties in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. These properties are subject to a regular and high turnover of residents, which can lead to damage and loss of equipment. We therefore require a supplier of furniture to provide us with the necessary items to restock temporary accommodation properties and occasionally, transport furniture from one property to another.
      
      Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council has recently built a multi-occupancy accommodation unit at Ipswich Walk in the north of the borough. This unit has already been stocked under a separate contractual arrangement; however the subsequent replacement of furniture items as required is expected to be covered by this supply contract. 
      
      Please note that the supply of these goods will be of a responsive, ad-hoc nature and therefore we cannot guarantee a specific volume or value of orders. 
      
      The Contract is due to commence on 1 November 2017 for a period of one year with an option to extend for a further four 12 month periods subject to satisfactory performance and mutual agreement.
      
      It is the Employer's intention to appoint one supplier under this Contract. 
      
      Minimum Requirements
      
      ? All tenderers must be able to demonstrate experience in supplying goods to a similar housing department or function where the focus is on temporary accommodation. 
      
      ? Suppliers must also be able to meet a requirement to deliver on a next day basis from the date the order is received. 
      
      
      The successful contractor is to be selected through a formal tender process.
      
      In order to be considered for the award of the contract, suppliers must express an interest in this tender and complete the enclosed tender documents by no later than 12:00 midday on Friday 13th October 2017.

Additional information: 
This contract will be tendered through an electronic tendering portal at visit www.csw-jets.co.uk. Organisations will not be able to access documents unless they are registered on this portal. 

All documents can be downloaded from and submitted via the portal. 

The deadline date for submission of tenders is 12:00 midday on Friday 13th October 2017.

One of the roles of the ASC is to scrutinise progress made by the government in managing climate change risks. The Committee makes use of evidence to assess whether the government is delivering its own objectives, and whether these objectives are in-line with managing the long-term changes in risk.

The UK Climate Change Risk Assessment 2017 found that rainfall patterns in the UK are intensifying, with the existing drainage and public sewerage network already under severe pressure in some areas. However, there is currently no government objective for managing this risk in the long term, and the overall impact of ongoing actions from local authorities and water companies is unknown.

The ASC would like to define metrics to measure progress made in managing surface flooding at the local level, based on available data, and collate these metrics to gain a national picture of the current situation.

We are one of the leading 'arm's length management organisations' (ALMOs) in the country. 
      
      SCH's responsibilities include the management and maintenance of the Council's housing stock, which includes approximately 92 temporary accommodation properties in the Metropolitan Borough of Solihull. These properties are subject to a regular and high turnover of residents, which can lead to damage and loss of equipment. We therefore require a supplier of white goods and electrical appliances to provide us with the necessary items to restock temporary accommodation properties.
      
      Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council is currently building multi-occupancy accommodation unit at Ipswich Walk in the north of the borough. This unit will be stocked under a separate contractual arrangement; however the subsequent replacement of white goods and electrical items as required is expected to be covered by this supply contract. 
      
      Please note that the supply of these goods will be of a responsive, ad-hoc nature and therefore we cannot guarantee a specific volume or value of orders. 
      
      The Contract is due to commence on 1 November 2017 for a period of one year with an option to extend for a further four 12 month periods subject to satisfactory performance and mutual agreement.
      
      It is the Employer's intention to appoint one supplier under this Contract. 
      
      Minimum Requirements
      
      ? All tenderers must be able to demonstrate experience in supplying goods to a similar housing department or function where the focus is on temporary accommodation. 
      
      ? Suppliers must also be able to meet a requirement to deliver on a next day basis from the date the order is received. 
      
      
      The successful contractor is to be selected through a formal tender process.
      
      In order to be considered for the award of the contract, suppliers must express an interest in this tender and complete the enclosed tender documents by no later than 12:00 midday on Friday 13th October 2017.

Additional information: 
This contract will be tendered through an electronic tendering portal at visit www.csw-jets.co.uk. Organisations will not be able to access documents unless they are registered on this portal. 

All documents can be downloaded from and submitted via the portal.

(Grid Reference: NS 986 541).

The site is accessed off several minor roads from the Auchengray Road to Pool Farm and then via shared farm access tracks. The Coal Authority has rights of access to the scheme over the farm access tracks from Pool Farm.

We require a permanent bypass channel installing to allow the maintenance of reed bed 2 this year. This needs to give the flexibility to take the reed bed off-line as required, so control by penstocks or stop-logs will be required.

A blocked-off connection shall be incorporated, to facilitate a future connection to the inlet structure. (This will then form a second partial bypass, allowing reed bed 1 to be taken off-line for maintenance).

You are invited to submit a tender for providing the Authority with this requirement.

The Fund aims to promote inclusive economic growth and development and enhance the UK's bilateral trade and investment with partners.

In 2015 UK goods exports to China amounted to £13.1bn and services exports to China amounted to £3.7bn, i.e. China was the 5th and 14th largest destination for the UK's goods and services exports, respectively. The stock of Foreign Direct Investment from the UK to China was £9.7bn in 2015, up 5% from 2014, and the stock of Foreign Direct Investment from China to the UK totalled £1.8 billion in 2015, a 68% increase from 2014. This all adds up to a huge opportunity for UK business.

The proposed projects (policy proposals to remove market access barriers; analysis and policy development in relation to UK-China investment flows and access; and the assessment of possible UK-China development zone models) will help prepare the way for the UK-China trade relationship in the 2020s.

Additional information: How to apply Instructions to Potential Providers:

Potential Providers must first be registered on the Crown Commercial Service e-Sourcing Suite in order to respond to the Procurement. If you have not yet registered on the e-Sourcing Suite, this can be done online at https://gpsesourcing.cabinetoffice.gov.uk by following the link 'Register for CCS e-Sourcing'.

Please note that, to register, you must have a valid DUNS number (as provided by Dun and Bradstreet) for the organisation which you are registering, who will be entering into a contract if invited to do so at the Invitation to Tender stage. Potential Providers should note that it could take up to 10 working days to obtain a DUNS number.
Full instructions for registration and use of the system can be found at:
http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/i-am-supplier/respond-tender

Once you have registered on the e-Sourcing Suite, you will need to express your interest by emailing ExpressionOfInterest@Crowncommercial.gov.uk

Your email must clearly state:
 - name/reference of this procurement
 - the name of the registered supplier; and
 - the name and contact details

Crown Commercial Service will then process your registration and assign your organisation to the opportunity. The registered user will receive a notification email to alert them once this has been done.

It is advised however that Potential Providers register as soon as practically possible in order to receive the Invitation to Tender and have a sufficient amount of time to respond. Crown Commercial Service is not able to offer any extensions to the advertised procurement timetable.

      For the purposes of this tender, Strategic Estates have estimated percentages of the 124 metres into individual paper formats as listed in the Pricing Schedule in Annex B.
      The library documents themselves date back to approximately 1970 and are all in reasonable condition with very little damage. Two files have been cleaned and treated for mould, and although safe to be handled, there is residual staining of the pages. 
      After the documents have been scanned, they are be archived in accordance with section 3.12 and Annex G.

These will not only allow us to provide exciting new retail opportunities for our customers, but also generate enhanced revenue to support investment in London's transport network. We anticipate these pods will mainly be occupied by A1, A3 and A5 tenants such as coffee bars, sandwich / snack retailers, confectionary outlets, newsagents and card retailers. TfL will be providing a steel / glass envelope with appropriate incoming services for tenants to fit out to suit their requirements. Tenant fit out will include the necessary fabric to support their business, but also services which could potentially include three phase power, HVAC and plumbing / drainage. 

TfL has procured a concept design for the pods which is detailed within this enquiry. We are seeking a supply chain to develop this design and then manufacture and install the units. There will also be an ongoing requirement for the provision of spare parts in the event of accidents, vandalism or other damage. 

Units are of steel and glass construction and are modular to allow various dimensional options as well as facilitating rapid installation and the possibility of straightforward location moves.

Additional information: Please complete and return the accompanying short questionnaire if you would be interested in taking part in this opportunity. 

The closing date for receipt of expressions of interest will be 17:00 on Thursday 5 October. Please send your responses by email to Benjamin Kennedy at benjaminkennedy@tfl.gov.uk. 

Following receipt of your expressions of interest, we may ask you to join us at our offices for a 1:1 engagement session about the opportunity. In your response, please also indicate whether you would be interested in participating in this engagement exercise. 

We look forward to your responses. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions in the meantime.

The firm should have a proven background in Financial Institution Group recruitment and provide a report detailing candidates for the three positions as well as having approached the possible candidates to gauge levels of interest. The three roles are detailed on the attached description.

How to apply Instructions to Potential Providers: 

Potential Providers must first be registered on the Crown Commercial Service e-Sourcing Suite in order to respond to the Procurement. If you have not yet registered on the e-Sourcing Suite, this can be done online at https://gpsesourcing.cabinetoffice.gov.uk by following the link 'Register for CCS e-Sourcing'. 

Please note that, to register, you must have a valid DUNS number (as provided by Dun and Bradstreet) for the organisation which you are registering, who will be entering into a contract if invited to do so at the Invitation to Tender stage. Potential Providers should note that it could take up to 10 working days to obtain a DUNS number. 
Full instructions for registration and use of the system can be found at: 
http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/i-am-supplier/respond-tender 

Once you have registered on the e-Sourcing Suite, you will need to express your interest by emailing ExpressionOfInterest@Crowncommercial.gov.uk. The dead line for expressing an interest in the Request for Information event is Monday 9th October 2017 at 13:00.

Your email must clearly state: 
- name/reference of this procurement 
- the name of the registered supplier; and 
- the name and contact details 

Crown Commercial Service will then process your registration and assign your organisation to the opportunity. The registered user will receive a notification email to alert them once this has been done. 

It is advised however that Potential Providers register as soon as practically possible in order to receive the Invitation to Tender and have a sufficient amount of time to respond. Crown Commercial Service is not able to offer any extensions to the advertised procurement timetable. 

For technical assistance on use of the e-Sourcing Suite please contact the 
Helpdesk: 
Freephone: 0345 010 3503


Update: 26th September 2017 - The registration for interested has been extended until the Monday 9th October 2017.
