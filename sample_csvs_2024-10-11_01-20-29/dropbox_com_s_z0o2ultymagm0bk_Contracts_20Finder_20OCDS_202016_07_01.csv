DO NOT apply directly to the buyer. All tender information MUST be submitted through the CCS eSourcing Portal. Any bids submitted directly to the buyer will be disregarded.

The Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) is looking to select an organisation to manage the 2016-2020 round of the “Study China” study visit programme on behalf of the Department.  Proposals are therefore invited from organisations working in partnership with Chinese institutions wishing to run study visits in China for students (our definition: over 17 years of age and studying at or about to study at UK HEIs [including colleges]) from Easter 2017 until summer 2020.  It is envisaged that approximately 350 UK students per year will participate in “Study China” during this period.  The 3 week visit should be designed to give UK-based students with little or no knowledge of China or the Chinese language the opportunity to learn some Mandarin and experience Chinese culture and business links. It is hoped that the study visit experience will encourage the students to explore further opportunities for study or work in China.   
Although the programme is UK-wide, the BIS funding only covers students studying in English HEIs.  Additional places are also made available to the Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and, subject to funds being made available by the Devolved Administrations, they will make their own separate arrangements with the successful bidder.

Tourism is important to the economy of Wealden, the latest figures available (2014/15) show that tourism injected over £258 million pounds to the local economy with 11.4% of the total Wealden workforce within the tourism industry.

The brief sets out two requirements to explore two options - the feasibility of developing a single major tourism attraction in the South of the District and to consider the feasibility of promoting the South of the District as a ‘destination’ in itself which would require niche markets and growth opportunities to be identified. The Council will require a three year action plan (2017-2020) so the Council and its wider partners can focus its resources effectively.

The previous Wealden Tourism strategy 2010-2015 is out of date and we wish to develop a Destination Management Plan to continue to support this business sector.

The requirement - Under section 12(2) of the Mental Health Act 1983 (“the MHA”) the Secretary of State for Health approves, for the purposes of that section, registered medical practitioners who have ""special experience in the diagnosis or treatment of mental disorder”(“s12 doctors”). Additionally, under section 145(1) of the MHA, the Secretary of State is to approve persons to act as “an approved clinician for the purposes of the Act” (“Approved Clinicians”). These functions are collectively referred to as ‘the Approval functions’.
The Approval functions have been vested in the Secretary of State since the enactment of the MHA, but had been delegated by virtue of regulations made under the National Health Service Act 1977 and directions issued under the National Health Service Act 2006, most recently to Strategic Health Authorities (“SHAs”). 
SHAs ceased to exist when the relevant provisions in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 came into force. The Department of Health became responsible for the Approval functions. Following a review and a procurement exercise the Secretary of State contracted with four approving bodies. These contracts are due to terminate on 31st March 2017. The Department of Health (“DH”) plans to seek bids from organisations to provide the services as described in the attached draft procurement documentation (the specification, ITT part B). As this notice (and the published prior Information notice) are at pre-procurement (pre Invitation to Tender) stage, the attached documents are therefore draft and for Information only, may change and may not fully reflect any eventual final versions.
The proposed Contract will cover four regions as described in the documentation; being Lot 1, Panel one - North of England. Lot 2, Panel Two - Midlands and East. Lot 3, Panel Three - London. Lot 4, Panel Four - South of England.
A pre-procurement event will be held on the 25th July 2016  in Central London. If you would be interested in attending this event, please email supplier.helpdesk@dh.gsi.gov.uk to register your interest by the 20th July. When expressing an interest organisation's should provide: 
(I) the contact details of the service provider's representative 
(ii) a single paragraph summary of your organisation's experience including whether you are a Small to Medium sized Enterprise or Voluntary Sector Organisation . This summary may be shared with other participants in order to promote discussion. An agenda and information pack will be sent to you. 
This notice is for Information only and the Department of Health reserves the right to not proceed to tender. See TUPE note.

Additional information: This notice is intended to provide information to interested bidders, and to advertise the supplier event. The event is intended to be an opportunity for interested suppliers to gain information on the requirement, ask questions, provide feedback on the draft specification, including any issues, and to network on the day.
Potential suppliers should note that, in accordance with Government's policies on transparency, DH intends to publish the Invitation to Tender (ITT) document, and the text of any Contract awarded, subject to possible redactions at the discretion of DH. Further information on transparency can be found at:
http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/transparency-overview.
This notice is for Information only and the Department of Health reserves the right to not proceed to tender additionally the Department reserves the right to discontinue the proposed tendering process and not to award the contract. The information contained in this notice is only indicative of the DH's current thinking and is neither exhaustive nor binding and the DH reserves the right at its absolute discretion to amend it at the time of issue of any further notice or notices or at any other time. The DH shall not be liable for any costs incurred by those expressing an interest in participating in the supplier day nor for any bid costs in any associated future procurement exercise.
The estimated value given includes the optional extension period.
The current expectation is that TUPE will apply and given that the staff expected to be in scope to transfer participate in the NHSPS it is expected that New Fair Deal will apply.

The PPF is a continuously developing business within a changing market and it is envisaged that there will be a future requirement for further components, modules or packages within the investment management area, such as Risk, Performance Measurement and Treasury including bespoke developments within the system which are reserved for the PPF's use only. It is fully envisaged that these components and modules will be developed over the life of the contract not only to reflect changes in the market, but also the Board's strategy, including, but not limited to, changes in approach to the amount of investment business retained or brought in-house, the nature and size of the Board's assets and liabilities and the Board's approach to risk and return. This may require additional components and modules not currently listed, or development of the Services themselves or existing services provided to the Board which support or are supported by these Services. It is further envisaged that additional software, including licences, may need to be developed to enhance the Services, to increase efficiency and streamline the Services, to increase the availability of the Services in line with changes in the market, anticipated changes to the Board's strategy over the life of the contract and changes in the nature and size of the Board's assets and liabilities or to develop other services that support or are supported by these Services.

General Practice to Diabetic Retinopathy Screening (GP2DRS) is a system intended to automate and improve the accuracy of patient cohort identification within the NHS Diabetic Eye screening programme (NDESP).  The system utilises data extraction tools provided and supported by the Health and Social Care Information Centre’s (HSCIC) GP Extraction Service (GPES) to identify patients with diabetes in GP practice IT systems. The identification depends on the accurate clinical coding of diabetic patients within GP systems.  The data is then collated by GPES, processed and sent to the GP2DRS database whereby it is made available to the 70 local screening programmes to update their databases.
The system is currently in pilot at 5 screening programmes.  The quality of the data being received from the system needs to be validated to ensure that the system can be deployed widely across England.
The chosen partner will manage the process of assuring the quality of the data being collected via GPES and ensuring that the data is aligned to the extraction specification and capable of being used by the screening programmes. The supplier must have the following essential experience and expertise:
1.	Experience of the Diabetic Eye Screening Dataset and the screening programme operations in relation to data collection and management.
2.	Expertise in the application and identification of READ codes in GP surgeries that use the EMIS, TPP, INPS and Microtest systems.
3.	Expertise in the use of Miquest query building and application.
4.

staff, materials and furniture, if required, to an alternative City of London office. The new
proposed office is approximately 21,000 square feet and is located within the EC4 post
code, just a few miles from our current location in Holborn.
The project, from award of contract (expected to be September 2016) to completion of
staff relocation from the existing office, must be completed by September 2017 at the
latest.
We expect this project to be undertaken in three phases consisting of design, fit out and
relocation and as such the tender, in conjunction with the “JCT Design and Build Contract
2011” (DB 2011), will be broken down into three distinct phases for the project.

Please express an interest in this opportunity to be provided with tender documentation as and when this becomes available.

The University of Sunderland is the fifth largest recruiter of international students in the UK. As well as our two Sunderland-based campuses we operate a site at Canary Wharf in London as well as delivering our programmes to 6,500 overseas students in their own countries. We also operate National Glass Centre, a centre of excellence and visitor attraction for contemporary glass.

The University is looking to make a significant service enhancement and cultural shift to how we engage with our student body.  Central to our approach will be the implementation and provisioning of a suitable Student Solution Centre (SSC) to provide a key touch point to student engagement throughout the student lifecycle journey that is capable of managing and directing enquiries, requests for assistance, complaints and booking appointments and places on workshops. We have conducted significant internal reviews and identified this requirement as centric to the successful management of the University of Sunderland specific  student journey through academia. 

University of Sunderland will invite bids for an SSC. The contract will involve design, customisation, installation, implementation, training and possible hosting, maintenance and support of this key requirement.

We will define an ambitious scope, covering the full student journey and expect this to be delivered by a suitable solution that will interface with other University of Sunderland systems. The ability of systems and solutions to provide a seamless user experience will be key as well as a suitable analytics tool to understand and report on user interfaces within the solution.

Suppliers taking part in any of the pre-market engagement will not be given any advantage or bias during the subsequent tender exercise, these sessions are to provide additional market intelligence and an insight into market trends and solution availability.

• The new Desistance and Disengagement programme will focus on those convicted of terrorism, or terrorism related offences, who have served their custodial sentences and are due to be released on licence.
• The programme will address the complex range of needs and factors that lead individuals to become involved in terrorism, and will run alongside statutory risk assessment and management processes such
as the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (‘MAPPA’).
• In addition to the existing interventions already available through those statutory partners, we believe an additional suite of psychological, theological and social/occupational provisions and mentoring will
provide the best possible means for these individuals to disengage from extremism and reintegrate safely back into society.
 • We recognise the skills and expertise the third sector holds in facilitating and encouraging social integration into society. We are therefore tendering for a Non-Governmental Organisation to deliver the

Staffordshire County Council is looking to explore potential block-booked domiciliary care provision in the County, specifically in the Districts of Stafford and surrounds, Newcastle under Lyme and Staffordshire Moorlands and surrounding areas.
This provision would be additional to existing supply to address areas where there is insufficient capacity to meet current demand. The Council is willing to consider a range of different approaches and alternative models, such as block booking capacity at peak times, set runs to assist maintenance packages of both community and hospital capacity and any other innovative models you may have.

Providers are invited to complete the below short questionnaire and return to  sp@staffordshire.gov.uk by 12 noon on 13th July 2016 to assist in the Soft Market Testing process.

Please note your response will not be scored in any way.  This is an information gathering exercise and is not a pre-qualification process.

The Commissioners are looking to get early engagement with providers and the market in general who share our passion and commitment and who are dedicated to providing the very best choice, service and patient care standards. 
The commissioners would like to discuss our plans with the market to understand capacity and the ability of providers to deliver the service including the procurement process, and to further discuss related tariff for audiology service. 
The service would be expected to undertake the full range of adult Audiology services and detailed service specifications will be published as part of the procurement process. However, the CCG would like to get potential provider views and ideas as well as assess current market appetite to provide this service. The outcomes of the event will then determine next steps. 
In due course, if appropriate, relevant OJEU notices will be published and the tender will commence via the Kent Business portal www.kentbusinessportal.org.uk

To underpin this objective it operates an energy monitoring, targeting and reporting system which receives data from around 2,000 AMR meters and 1,000 non AMR hourly meters (400 of which are invoiced by utility suppliers) for electricity, heat, steam, gas and water.  This data is provided by a number of sources including utility suppliers, text messages, SFTP transfer via the in-house data collection system using Modbus and M-bus.  The data collected is used to produce a variety of reports to support the management of energy costs and consumption, provide feedback to users of the building, compliance reporting (E.g. EU ETS and Display Energy Certificates), charging third parties and by the in-house team who need an overview of utility use on-site and variances together with the ability to interrogate the lowest level of metering.

The University requires a software solution that will provide a cost effective means of recording utility consumption, verifying and producing invoices, analysing and reporting its consumption of energy and water and the resulting carbon footprint.  We also desire to use this information together with other sources (e.g. the Schneider Building Management System) to provide feedback to consumers of energy/water.

Ideally we would wish to procure one system however if our requirements can best be met by more than one system then we will consider this option. 


Additional information: The value suggested is based on a 7 year contract with the option to extend up to 10 years.

About UK Shared Business Services 
Putting the business into shared services
UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise.
It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector.

Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. 

Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams.
UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It’s what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre. What is more, being a not-for-profit organisation owned by its customers, UK SBS’ goals are aligned with the public sector and delivering best value for the UK taxpayer.
UK Shared Business Services Ltd changed its name from RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd in March 2013.
Our Customers
Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Service (CSS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.

The procurement is likely to commence in August 2016, and the new contract is due to begin in April 2017.

The procurement will be for the College Health practice in Chatham.

The contract term is envisaged to be for an initial 3 year period, with the option to renew for a further 2 years; this is subject to approval and the precise term will be advised at a later date.  The contract will have an annual value in the region of £620,000.  More detail will be available as the procurement process proceeds.

The vision at Medway Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is to help people keep healthy and active and live longer healthier lives; not waiting until people become unwell for the health service to see them.

We recognise our role in reducing health inequalities in terms of both outcomes and access to services, and have placed prevention and health improvement at the heart of our strategic plan.

Medway CCG comprises 53 GP member practices from across the Medway towns, responsible for planning and buying local NHS services, serving a practice population of 309,033.

Our 2015/16 annual report identifies the following key points:

•	According to the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) mid-2013 population estimate, Medway's resident population is 271,105, an increase of 21,405 (8.6%) since 2001.. However net out-migration since 2001 has reduced overall population growth over this period.

•	Approximately 2,000 Medway residents die each year (2,072 deaths in 2013), with significantly higher mortality rates found in males than females.

•	The majority of the population (85.9%) in Medway are classified as White British, with the next largest ethnic group being Asian or Asian British (5.0% - not including Chinese). The three wards with the most ethnically diverse school populations are Chatham Central, Gillingham south and River wards.

•	The population of Medway is slightly younger than the national average with a median of 37.7 years of age compared to the England median of 39.9 years.


•	2011 to 2037 projections suggest that the proportion of the population aged 65 years or over will increase from 14.0% (37,200) to 21.4% (70,000). The equivalent change in those aged 85 years and over is from 1.7% (4,400) to 3.7% (12,000).
•	The number of people over 65 years with a limiting long-term illness is expected to increase by 48.3% from 2014 to 2030, which would have a significant impact on the demand for health services for the management of long-term conditions such as dementia, heart disease and diabetes as the incidence of these conditions increases with age.

Additional information: The outcomes that NHS England wishes to secure from the procurement include:
* Sustainable primary care, working at scale, based on Local Care Teams, aimed at integrating community based services around local populations
* Good access to services, both in Core Hours and beyond
* High quality management of long term conditions and health promotion

A Market event will take place on July 20th between 12.30 and 2.00 in the Medway area, to provide potential bidders with the opportunity to ask questions and hear more detail of the procurement process. If you are interested in bidding for this contract, please hold this date in your diary; more detail will follow nearer the time. 

If you wish to express an interest in taking part in a future procurement exercise to identify a provider to deliver these services, please register on the In-Tend portal and submit a completed Provider Sounding Questionnaire by 12pm on 18th July  2016.

To register on In-Tend please visit:

It is looking to commission the production of a Housing Asset Management Strategy to inform the maintenance, development and management of its housing stock into the future.   This is an important strategy, and therefore will require consultants to have demonstrable experience of developing strategies in a collaborative way with key officers and stakeholders, to ensure the brief is fulfilled.  

Stoke-on-Trent City Council is a stock holding authority with circa 18,600 properties within its Housing Revenue Account property portfolio, with associated assets including garage sites, shops and cleared land.  Occupied by a diverse range of tenants.  

The Council’s housing stock is the Council’s highest value asset and within this the repairs and maintenance of the stock is the Council’s largest liability, therefore successful planning for its sustainable future is therefore vital.

Whilst the council will continue to place primary focus on management, maintenance and refurbishment of existing stock through a major works programme which is driven by the council’s approach to achieving stock decency, the intention is to look at the wider scope of the asset base through the development of the Housing Revenue Account Asset Management Strategy.  This may include the use of vacant sites, the potential redevelopment of existing sites and the potential use of Housing Revenue Account funds for acquisition and/or development of new property.

As part of the specification design phase these DAS were updated to Technical Standards to include changes to the design and specific route wide requirements.

As part of the parliamentary design a functional definition of the new High Speed Railway (HSR) was assessed through the System Safety principles and the DAS were used as evidence to show that design decisions taken did not preclude the possibility of hazard acceptance within the more detailed design stages. However, the DAS and Technical Standards have not been fully reviewed to identify where safety requirements have been raised and where they form the basis for hazard acceptance in accordance with the HS2 Railway System Safety Strategy.

Therefore the scope of the services required by this contract is to review the approximately 51 Technical Standards to: 
•	Identify safety requirements listed in the Technical Standards;
•	Identify if the clauses in the Technical Standards are likely to close the hazards under the Common Safety Method on Risk Assessment (CSM-RA);
