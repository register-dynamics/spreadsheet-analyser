Technology Enabled Care (TEC), also known as telecare, refers to a range of services that use alarms and sensors that are monitored 24/7 by a dedicated alarm receiving centre. The service enables users to access support when they need it and provides reassurance not just to clients but also to their carers, family and friends.  
      
      The Council wishes to collaborate with the Strategic Partner to achieve long-term benefits and innovation based on mutually desired outcomes, where resources are shared in a way that promotes positive outcomes for all and maximises external funding. Planned developments include:  
      Introducing an urgent, short-term provision that is not constrained by the current Care Act eligibility criteria to support admission avoidance and hospital discharge. This would initially only be available to adult social care clients upon discharge but with the potential to extend the offer should funding be identified from Health services.  
      Moving away from current investment in a single brand of equipment and moving to a supplier agnostic model, utilising alternative equipment provision that best supports the client and ensures best value for the Council.  
      Increased emphasis on using the intelligence gained from TEC service provision to inform decisions relating to clients care needs.

This requires work to be undertaken to identify feasible locations to implement both micro ""20-minute neighbourhood"" projects (such as community gardens and edible bus stops) and a full-scale pilot scheme for the model.
The aim behind the idea of 20-minute neighbourhoods (20MNs) is to create walkable, liveable environments that are attractive, interesting, and safe in which people of all ages and various levels of fitness can travel actively for short distances from home to the destinations and services they need to use day-to-day. This includes access to shopping, recreation and leisure activities, schools, and local services such as GP surgeries. People may then work at or near home or work more in local businesses or hubs and travel to work beyond their neighbourhood is made easier through high-quality public transport and active travel connections. In this way, inclusive and intergenerational communities are supported. 
There are multiple economic, environmental, health and social benefits to 20MNs, which include for example: supporting local businesses through community wealth building; addressing climate change by reducing local emissions; improving access to healthier food; and tackling health inequalities through increasing physical activity levels and better mental health.",,complete,CPV,71313000,"Environmental engineering consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"BN7 1UE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,49450,GBP,limited,"Competitive quotation (below threshold)",2022-11-18T12:00:00Z,,2023-01-23T00:00:00Z,2023-05-30T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-LAE-ESX,"East Sussex County Council","East Sussex County Council",GB-LAE,ESX,"County Hall,St. Annes Crescent",LEWES,BN71UE,England,"Orbis Procurement",OrbisSourcingSolutions@eastsussex.gov.uk,,,buyer,GB-COH-08533500,"Troy Hayes Planning Ltd","Troy Hayes Planning Ltd",GB-COH,08533500,"41-42 Foley Street

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement

JASMIN is a world class data analysis facility which currently consists of a range of computing systems connected to a set of storage tiers. Included within these systems is the JASMIN cloud, which provides users with access to either managed and / or external cloud tenancies, with access to a combination of compute services and data storage. The JASMIN cloud capacity has been developed over recent years in response to user requirements but has now reached a point where the underlying provision of OpenStack is not an optimal basis for future expansion. There is therefore a need for an objective review of options to identify the most appropriate way forward. 

The major objective of this action is to secure access to the necessary expertise to enable a robust evaluation of options for the future provision of cloud services within JASMIN. This includes consideration of the current provision and likely future requirements, the opportunities arising from existing and emerging technologies, and the evaluation of possible future development paths for the provision of JASMIN cloud services.

Brief Description of Requirement

JASMIN is a world class data analysis facility which currently consists of a range of computing systems connected to a set of storage tiers. Included within these systems is the JASMIN cloud, which provides users with access to either managed and / or external cloud tenancies, with access to a combination of compute services and data storage. The JASMIN cloud capacity has been developed over recent years in response to user requirements but has now reached a point where the underlying provision of OpenStack is not an optimal basis for future expansion. There is therefore a need for an objective review of options to identify the most appropriate way forward. 

The major objective of this action is to secure access to the necessary expertise to enable a robust evaluation of options for the future provision of cloud services within JASMIN. This includes consideration of the current provision and likely future requirements, the opportunities arising from existing and emerging technologies, and the evaluation of possible future development paths for the provision of JASMIN cloud services.

Additional information: 
Please register via the Council`s e-procurement system - CSW-JETS   https://in-tendhost.co.uk/csw-jets

CSW-JETS is a sub-regional e-tendering portal run by In-tend. Since February 2010, Coventry; Solihull; Warwickshire; Nuneaton and Bedworth; Rugby alongside other local district Councils have been working together as a shared procurement service. In conjunction with Solihull Community Housing, we have joined together to bring you a collaborative E-Tendering portal. 

CSW-JETS enables us to advertise our opportunities across all authorities through the same system. This means that there is a single point of contact for procurement in the sub-region so you only have to register once to receive notifications for all authorities. Registering on the portal will make it easier for local suppliers to find, respond to and be alerted to tender opportunities. 

Registration is free, and takes just a few minutes. When complete, you will be able to express interest in any of the Councils'/Authorities' opportunities when they are made available including this tender. In addition, we will be able to access your details whenever we have a requirement, and you may then be invited to tender or quote for work.

Once you are registered and log in to the system you will be able to locate the tender opportunity, express interest and access the documentation.

Brief Description of Requirement

UK government's National AI Strategy set out a 10-year plan to make Britain a global superpower. The output from the work we are looking to tender with this document aligns with the priorities set out under Pillar 1 and 2 of the National AI strategy and more specifically with the need for applied AI technologies to new use cases and ensuring AI benefits all sectors of the UK economy. 

A previous report has suggested that AI could benefit the UK economy by an uplift of 22% GDP. With this tender, we are looking to identify a short list of options and associated economic benefits for investing in the expansion of capabilities by Digital Catapult to develop a national resource for the acceleration of testing and development of new AI & ML solutions. The Digital Catapult already has capability in this technology and delivers a number of different business support functions including the Machine Intelligence Garage and INJECT. We seek to identify and prioritise a list of additional investment options that have the capacity to accelerate the adoption of AI technologies in the UK economy.

The services tendered in this document seek to identify and quantify ROI from a short list of possible investment options to expand Digital Catapults&apos; capabilities in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning and associated enabling technologies/infrastructure to support the acceleration of adoption of AI & ML in the industry.

The work will be delivered in two phases. The information gathering phase 1, that will lead to an interim report to outline the key findings gathered and phase 2 that will engage in evaluating and analysing information gathered and lead to writing of the final documents.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Supplier Attachments tab within the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the ITQ document.

The Trial is already being implemented in the wider London, Portsmouth, Liverpool City and Hull regions.

We are holding an information session for interested providers on 8 February 2023.  If you would like to attend, please register your interest by email to centralmailbox.drugandalcoholpolicy@DWP.gov.uk  and include email addresses for your attendees (maximum of two (2) per supplier).

Employment makes an important contribution to gaining and sustaining recovery from a substance dependency.  However, it can be difficult for Jobcentre Plus to support individuals with an addiction.  Individuals are often unwilling to disclose their dependency to Work Coaches due to denial, shame or fear that they may be sanctioned in some way.  Other individuals with a dependency may not be engaged with DWP at all.  As a result, individuals are not able to receive the help and support they need to overcome their tendency and move towards or in to work.

Peer Mentors will work in partnership with Jobcentre Plus staff and use their lived experience to support individuals disclose their dependency, access appropriate support (including treatment, housing and financial services) and move towards employment.

Peer Mentor support will include holding a minimum of eight (8) face-to-face sessions with Mentees; conducting a diagnostic interview with Mentees to identify their needs and barriers; producing a SMART action plan for each Mentee; acting as an advocate for recovery and supporting Mentees carry out steps from their action plan such as helping them navigate various services, encouraging them to engage in training or employment opportunities. Providers will be required to demonstrate a track record of engaging with drug and alcohol dependents and treatment services; recruit Peer Mentors with lived experience of drug or alcohol dependency; suitably train Peer Mentors in supporting Mentees with complex needs; implement appropriate structures to manage, supervise and safeguard Peer Mentors and Mentees; deliver the provision in a location which is accessible to customers from the dedicated Jobcentre Plus offices; and raise awareness of the Peer Mentoring Trial through new and existing relationships and networks.

Interested providers will need to hold ISO27001 and Cyber Essentials certification and be accredited on the DWP Test and Learn Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) under the Peer Support service line in order to be invited to submit a tender for this opportunity.

Across the University, cafés are operated by the University of Plymouth subsidiary, University Commercial Services Plymouth Ltd (UCSP), who also put sustainability at the heart of their operations. USCP have received many recognitions for their work on sustainability, including with a three-star rating from the Sustainable Restaurant Association in the Food Made Good report and ranking joint first in the UK for sustainable food in the People and Planet 2021 league table.

Continuing on the University's and UCSPs journey on continual sustainability improvements, we are looking to work on a project to eliminate waste from disposable coffee cups. This form of waste has numerous barriers to being recycled, and even with disposable plant based alternatives there is no direct route for these items to be recycled. Along with this, the disposable cups present a confusing material for consumers to dispose of correctly, and often is misplaced into recycling, leading to contamination. 

We are therefore looking to implement a deposit-return scheme at the University cafés, whereby we can maintain the convenience of take-away hot drinks but remove the waste generated. We have built a list of criteria, highlighting that we need to ensure this remains affordable to students, commercially viable, and match our sustainability objectives. 

There are 10 cafés operated by UCSP at the University, and a further catering outlet within the students union (separately operated by UPSU) that we would aim to roll out a deposit return scheme to. We want to pilot the scheme before a full launch with a smaller number of deposit-return cups before the end of this academic year, so that we can achieve a full launch in September 2023.

The strategy commits to develop a longer term financial and commissioning strategy to ensure there are specialist services for victims of domestic abuse and sexual abuse. 
In 2019 Doncaster saw a spike in sexual abuse cases of 3.7% compared to the previous year in line with England. 
Doncaster Councils Crime and Community Safety Report highlights a reduction in sexual abuse and rape throughout 2020 and an increase in other sexual offences compared to 2019.
Whilst the reduction in sexual abuse and rape cases are positive, it's important to note that the numbers remain high, the pandemic likely had an impact on the reporting of offences and the reduction is much lower than the South Yorkshire average.

The contrcat will be three years with option to extend for two years. The contract value given in this notice is for five years.

      We are commissioning 2022-2023 and 2023-2024 together for this project. Please indicate if you would like to be considered for programme 1 or programme 2 or both. Please also specify if you would also be interested in delivering these projects in year three.
      
      Research suggests that many businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises have not yet made any plans or taken any action to decarbonise their business and that on-going expert support (rather than one-off interventions) will help them to start and progress their decarbonisation journeys. 
      We are commissioning two programmes of support; the two programmes will deliver advice and support to help businesses with 0-100 employees to lower their carbon footprint and reduce costs. 
      Further information is contained in our expression of interest document.)

The intended use of the new CNC fibre laser cutter is two-fold. Firstly, it will be used to educate groups of students on the state-of-the-art manufacturing process and secondly to facilitate the manufacture of a vast array of components designed by students and University staff for a variety of projects, teaching aids and maintenance components. 

Usually there are 2 main driving factors when it comes to selecting an appropriate laser cutter; working area, i.e., the largest piece of material that can fit within the machine, and the power of the laser source. However due to the lack of space within the departments building it is more applicable to state the size of the space available for the machine and then base our selection on how well a certain machine maximises its overall size in comparison with the available working area.  In terms of laser power, we will specify the thicknesses of different materials we cut and allow the manufacturers to recommend a laser power. 

The use of the machine also drives our specification as typically these machines are designed for high volume production whereas our machine will be used for very low volume but by many different users of different skill sets so safety and ease of use is of importance in addition to speed. It is essential that students and members of staff can be quickly and easily trained to use the machine with very little support from technical staff as the work hours involved with this would be un-feasible.

ELWA is also responsible for the disposal of commercial waste collected by the Constituent Councils. 

The current Integrated Waste Management Services (IWMS) Contract, which was signed in December 2002 with ELWA Ltd (the IWMS Contractor) and is operated by Renewi (the IWMS Operator), includes infrastructure for mechanical biological treatment, waste transfer, and Reuse and Recycling Centres (RRCs) for use by the general public. The IWMS Operator also has a number of sub-contractors for services, including the provision of material recovery facilities for mixed recycling, offtake of materials, transfer and RRC facilities. The IWMS Contract expires in December 2027. Further details on ELWA and the services it provides can be found at https://eastlondonwaste.gov.uk/.

A new Joint Strategy for East London's Resources and Waste for the period from 2027 to 2057 has been developed by ELWA and the Constituent Councils, which has been ratified by all five authorities in February 2022. The Joint Strategy sets out a direction of travel for the future management of waste after the expiry of the IWMS Contract that includes: ambition to increase recycling levels; accessing more affordable solutions to managing the waste streams; and, working to reduce emissions; all of which are identified as key priorities. Further details on the joint strategy can be found at https://eastlondonwaste.gov.uk/jointstrategy/. 

ELWA is currently developing its Outline Business Case and procurement strategy to deliver new arrangements for waste treatment and disposal in time for expiry of the IWMS Contract (the ""Requirement"").

To inform the development of the Outline Business Case and procurement strategy, ELWA is engaging with the market to better understand the market&apos;s interest in providing waste treatment and disposal services to ELWA and the infrastructure and capacity which will be available to meet the Requirement.  Consequently, ELWA invites you to respond to some or all of the questions set out in the Market Operator Briefing Note], depending on which areas are more pertinent to your business. 
The Market Operator Briefing Note is available from the BRAVO system.

All responses to the questions will be taken into account in the development of ELWA&apos;s Outline Business Case and procurement strategy.

The Authority aims to grow a green economy and sustain thriving rural communities. We also support our world-leading food, farming and fishing industries.

The Authority requires a Contractor to provide an Impact, Process, and Value for Money evaluation of the of the Food Data Transparency Partnership (FDTP). The project is planned to commence in spring 2023 and last until January 2028.

The key objective of the FDTP is to transform the impact the food system has on health, environmental and animal welfare outcomes, by:
•	Creating the right incentives for industry to sell and promote healthier food produced to higher animal welfare and environmental standards.
•	Allowing consumers to make better informed purchasing decisions based on clear, standardised, and trusted information
•	Supporting government to make effective policy based on more precise and timely information
The Government announced its intention to establish the FDTP as part of the 2022 Government Food Strategy. The FDTP is a multi-year partnership with the ambition to bring together government departments and agencies in England and the Devolved Administrations, including DHSC, the FSA and Food Standards Scotland, with representatives from across the whole food supply chain and civil society. The FDTP aims to address the following challenges:
•	Insufficient and inconsistent data to drive effective policy making
•	Difficulty for some consumers to purchase food from companies which aligns with their values
•	Lack of a level playing field on what information is reported by the food industry, has resulted in companies not being adequately incentivised and supported to address the unintentional environmental, health and animal welfare harms created within the food system
•	Current marketing claims on environmental impact and sustainability are largely inconsistent, which can lead to consumer confusion 
•	Data is not standardised or harmonised which leads to duplication, gaps, and inefficiencies 
•	A need to streamline data reporting requirements for food and drink businesses to minimise the reporting burden on business.
•	The FDTP aims to implement several interventions to address these challenges.

The service will ensure delivery of quality-assured marine environmental data to relevant parties to provide an evidence-base underpinning policy decisions within the UK and Europe. This shall include undertaking minor enhancements to the MERMAN database (for example, adjusting data validation rules, updating reference data and spreadsheet templates, and updating the station dictionary), as necessary, (estimate 10 instances, per annum), coordination of data submissions and transfer of quality-controlled data in a timely manner to International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) and European Marine Observation and Data Network (EMODnet) and supporting data requests by other third parties. These requirements, defined by Defra and members of the Clean Safe Seas Evidence Group (CSSEG), have been successfully delivered between 2006-2022 and there must be a seamless transition from the old system to the new.  
The MERMAN database is currently being redesigned to allow the system to incorporate new data types, respond effectively to changes in ICES submission requirements, act interoperable with other marine data systems, and streamline data validation processes.   The Authority would like an initial term of 2years with a further 2years extension.

Please note that we have a separate RFI document available to suppliers. This can be requested by contacting the following email address: DgC.E-Commercial.systems@defra.gov.uk. Please also note that the deadline for responses to the RFI is 28 February 2023, 12:00 GMT, and we therefore advise interested suppliers to make contact as soon as possible in order to access this.      The above is neither an exhaustive nor a final set of requirements. It is subject to development prior to any potential subsequent contract opportunity notice utilising the outputs from the RFI responses.                        
Potential providers are advised that should the Contracting Authority subsequently publish a formal contract notice, the procurement will be managed (including the submission of tender responses) via the Contracting Authority's e-procurement portal.

Lot 1 - Pay & Display Parking Solutions
Lot 2 - Pay on Foot Parking Solutions
Lot 3 - Cashless Parking (Mobile) Solutions
Lot 4 - Civil Enforcement Solutions

The framework agreement has the option to extend for up to a further 24 months. The total estimated value stated includes the option period.

ESPO shall monitor the financial stability of the awarded suppliers during the period of the Framework Agreement by reference to credit ratings agency reports. ESPO shall obtain a credit score for the suppliers on or before the Framework start date as a base score and where a significant change is identified over the life of the Framework Agreement, ESPO reserves the right to investigate the reasons for this significant change. Depending on the severity of the offences involved, it will be at the sole discretion of ESPO to suspend or even permanently remove the supplier from the Framework Agreement.

To tender: (a) Go to https://www.eastmidstenders.org/; (b) Register (if not already registered on ProContract); (c) Search for tender opportunity '509_23' (via ""View Opportunities"" from the 'EastMidsTenders' Portal); (d) Express an interest; (e) Download the tender from the website (documents can be found in the first question of the Online Questionnaire, but to see these you will first need to click on ""Start my response"" followed by ""Edit"" next to the Question set, and ""Answer question"" next to the first question).

Note: The Closing date for submission of Tenders has been extended to 12:00, 09 February 2023.

Additional information: As a Central Purchasing Body as defined in the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, the Framework Agreement is open for use by Public Bodies (defined at https://www.espo.org/amfile/file/download/file/9608/) that also fall into one of the following classifications of user throughout all administrative regions of the UK: Local Authorities; Educational Establishments (including Academies); Central Government Departments and Agencies; Police, Fire & Rescue and Coastguard Emergency Services; NHS and HSC Bodies, including Ambulance Services; Registered Charities; Registered Social Landlords; The Corporate Office of the House of Lords, The Corporate Officer of the House of Commons; or any public body established by or under the Scotland Act 1998 or any Act of the Scottish Parliament. Details of the classification of end user establishments and geographical areas are available at: https://www.espo.org/legal.

ESPO has established a commercial trading company, ESPO Trading Limited, whose target clients are third sector organisations such as national and local charities, public sector mutual organisations and other organisations involved in the delivery of services to or for the public sector. The successful Supplier may be asked to enter into an additional separate framework agreement (the Second Framework) with ESPO Trading Limited on materially similar terms to that found in the tender pack to be entered into by ESPO itself.

Any Second Framework agreement will be a purely commercial agreement and will, for the avoidance of doubt, not be governed by the Public Contract Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. ESPO Trading Limited may enter into the second framework agreement with the successful supplier and make it available to third sector clients who themselves are not required to follow the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 or other public procurement legislation. Accordingly, this is provided for bidders information only.

An eAuction process may be used to award subsequent call off contracts following the reopening of competition among the parties to the Framework Agreement.",2023-01-03T10:28:05Z,active,CPV,30144200,"Ticket-issuing machines",CPV,34926000,"Car park control equipment",CPV,34996300,"Control, safety or signalling equipment for parking facilities",CPV,38730000,"Parking meters",CPV,48000000,"Software package and information systems",CPV,50000000,"Repair and maintenance services",CPV,51214000,"Installation services of parking meter equipment",CPV,63712400,"Parking services",CPV,98351000,"Car park management services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,75000000,GBP,open,"Open procedure (above threshold)",2023-02-09T12:00:00Z,,2023-04-01T00:00:00+01:00,2025-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,1,goods,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/a8cc009b-f8c7-4dd0-bebf-48484363efc8,2023-01-03T10:28:05Z,2023-01-26T09:44:41Z,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"EastMidsTenders Procurement Portal",https://www.eastmidstenders.org/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/8vt52CDf,Espo,Espo,GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/8vt52CDf,"Barnsdale Way, Grove Park, Enderby",LEICESTER,"LE19 1ES",England,"Place & Environment Procurement Team",tenders@espo.org,,https://www.espo.org/,buyer,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/8vt52CDf,Espo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
