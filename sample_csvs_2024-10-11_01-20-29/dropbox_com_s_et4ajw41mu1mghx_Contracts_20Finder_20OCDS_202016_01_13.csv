• Rapid response 
• In-reach/ supported discharge 
• Rehabilitation 
• Reablement 

The CCG is inviting interested parties to engage with it on the future provision of these services with a view to seeking input and feedbackto help inform the CCG as it considers its requirements and routes to market. 

The above services are part of a number of intermediate care services available to patients, currently being delivered by various providers. 

NHS England has made a commitment to developing a coherent 24/7 urgent care service in every area of England that makes sense to patients when having to make choices about care and to drive the integration of services. It also committed to the provision of integrated NHS services seven days a week in order that patients experience genuine seven day care. It is expected that better integration will be delivered through: 

- Improved communications within and between service providers; 
- Improved coordination of services; 
- Reduced duplication of services and activities. 

A draft Memorandum of Information (MoI) and current service specification are available for review, being attached to this Notice for download. An engagement questionnaire has also been developed to capture input from providers to help inform the CCG’s key decisions around these services. You are invited to respond to the questionnaire and return to us by the deadline below.

The current contract value relating to the above services is expected to total circa £22,700,000 over the life of the  contract. If the CCG decides to undertake a formal procurement process then this is anticipated to commence in February 2016 through a notice on Contracts Finder, with the intention to have a contract(s) awarded by the end of April 2016 and for services to commence in July 2016. The integrated CIS will commence in July 2016, other services may follow later in the contract. 

***Providers are invited to express their interest in the early engagement via emailing the completed questionnaire to anne.elgeti@nw.london.nhs.uk THE DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS is 25th JANUARY 2016.***

Additional information: Note: An expression of interest is no indication of a commitment to participate in any subsequent procurement process, nor does it infer any special status on those providers who do submit an interest. Neither will this notice or any organisation’s expression of interest commit the CCG to undertake any procurement of the Community Independence Service or other Intermediate Care services & the CCG has a right to withdraw the notice. 

The CCG’s ambition is to combine services across geographies to improve lives and make public funds go further for the people we serve. In common with the rest of England, they are experiencing an unprecedented period of growing demands on current services, with limited resources to meet these demands.

Reports will be submitted to the Head of Internal Audit in the House of Lords but will be of interest to both the House of Lord s and the House of Commons.

The requirement is for the provision of specialist audit services to provide assurance on capital projects and programmes and other works related activities and operations within Parliament. This strength of this assurance will be increased if a single contractor develops an understanding of the requirements of the parliamentary estate and builds a constructive relationship with relevant parliamentary officials. For this reason, the contract will not be divided into separate lots.

The House of Commons currently has in place a contract for Provision of Internal Audit Support, which is split into the following Lots: specialist ICT services, specialist capital contract / project assurance services, support to in the in-house Internal Audit team and counter fraud services.  The end date for this contract is 30 September 2017. It is envisaged that a longer joint contract will be put in place from October 2017 which will incorporate the internal audit requirements of both Houses of Parliament. 

The work cannot be broken down into Lots as the various elements are interlinked and indivisible, a single supplier is required on the grounds of consistency and continuity.

Part of the original 1960s design, the Spine affords a partially covered route giving access to the principal academic buildings along with retail and service facilities. An accessible utility duct runs beneath the full length of the Spine. 
The University is currently celebrating its 50th year and occupies a position in the top 100 universities in the world. In order maintain that position and to provide facilities appropriate to the 21st century, Lancaster University seeks to remodel and upgrade the Spine to provide a vibrant, light, safe, weather protected route, offering a variety of environments along its length, reinforcing its identity as the main Campus thoroughfare.

Bidders are asked to submit their tenders based on two possible options:

Option A: A single construction phase commencing in July 2016, completing in July 2017
for both the North and South Spine. This option is reliant on the University obtaining the necessary funding for phase 2. Please note Lancaster University will not commit itself to this package of works and reserves the right to award a single contract for phase 1 

Option B: Two construction phases commencing in July 2016

•	Phase 1 – The North Spine (Alexandra Square northwards) 2016-2017.
•	Phase 2 – The South Spine (South of Alexandra Square) 2017-2018.
Contractor input in phasing and buildability advice will be sought and will be critical to the success of the project. A major consideration will be how best to minimise disturbance to the regular business of the University by the use of innovative construction techniques, off site preparation and prefabrication. This may allow extended access for work during term times.
