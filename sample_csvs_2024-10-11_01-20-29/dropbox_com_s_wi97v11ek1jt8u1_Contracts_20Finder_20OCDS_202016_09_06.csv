The contract is expected to be for up to 5 years (3 years initial term, with a 2 year option to extend) and to commence April 2017. The likely annual contract value is up to £550,000.

The aim of NHS Milton Keynes CCG for its musculoskeletal system is to provide effective treatment with the best possible patient experience for the investment made. 

The objectives of the IMSK service are to:
Provide Outpatient clinics closer to home for the patients 
Reduce the congestion on the secondary care waiting lists by diverting patients who do not need to go to a secondary care outpatient clinic and therefore help MKCCG and providers to achieve the 18 week Referral to Treatment target (RTT) 
Produce a ‘one stop shop’ for patients wherever possible to reduce the pathway time. 
Reduce the cost of the Outpatient appointments versus Payment by Results (PbR), either by commissioning services at a lower overall cost; reduce significantly the number of follow ups, whilst maintaining or improving a high quality of patient experience.

The Council’s aspiration for this market consultation is as follows:

1)  to allow the City Council to gain a greater understanding of the wider market opportunities, key developments and trends in relation to DCFM  services 
2)  to allow the City Council to consider options for shaping the structure and scope of these services in a way that is appropriate to Council business needs and priorities over the medium to long-term
3)  to allow public and private sector businesses /partnerships to express their interest and offer ideas for the delivery of these services. 
4)  to get a better understanding of the commercial opportunities (e.g. growth, investment and profit sharing) associated with these services 

Background

The current arrangements for delivering professional construction-related services were first explored by the Council in 2009, with approval being given to develop a Wholly-Owned Company given in January 2011.  BCC’S Wholly owned company – Acivico (Design Construction and Facilities Management) Limited and Acivico Integrated Services Ltd (Building Cleaning, Catering, and Birmingham City Laboratories Services (Acivico Ltd) (“BCC’s WOC”) was created as the Council’s Wholly-owned Company for these (and potentially future) services and were given for the term of a 5-year contract the exclusive right to undertake services outlined in this questionnaire for the Council up to end March 2017.  
As a Wholly-Owned Teckal company, Acivico is contracted to the Council as contract administrator, managing agent and for some services, a direct deliverer.

The Department of Health defines Non-emergency Patient Transport Service (NEPTS or PTS) activity as being the non-urgent, planned transportation of patients, with a medical need for transport, to and from premises providing NHS healthcare.  This encompasses a wide range of vehicle types and levels of care consistent with the patients’ medical needs. The overarching principle of PTS is that patients who are eligible for transport will receive safe, timely, comfortable and appropriate transport, without detriment to their medical condition.

The requirement for BNSSG is split into two lots:
• Lot 1: BNSSG Patient Transport Services (PTS)
• Lot 2: BNSSG Renal Patient Transport Services 

In accordance with Public Contracts Regulations 2015, 46 (6); the contracting authorities reserve the right to award contracts combining both lots to the same tenderer.

The commissioners are considering a number of ways that PTS can be delivered in the BNSSG area, and wish to have further discussions with bidders regarding the risks and benefits of these options.  

The options in consideration by the commissioners are attached to this advert as a supporting document.

The contract will be based on a 5 year period with the option to extend by a further 2 years. The annual contract value is in the region of £3,900,000 per annum for lot 1 and in the region of £750,000 per annum for lot 2.  Final awarded values may differ to those noted above in line with the options and potential variations outlined above. 

The contract start date(s) will be the 1st of April 2017 to 31st March 2022, with an option to extend by a further two years at the Commissioners discretion.

The Commissioner is following a form of Accelerated Competitive Procedure with Negotiation due to urgency outside of the Authority's control.

The British Council is seeking a supplier to design and deliver a pilot teacher development programme that works with the existing inspectorate system to improve the pedagogical skills of newly qualified teachers (of primary, middle and secondary schools across a range of curriculum subject areas) in Algeria. The supplier will develop a draft continuous professional development (CPD) framework that focuses on developing improved pedagogical skills and design, and deliver and support an appropriate accompanying training programme for inspectors, who will then work with teachers. Given the short timeframe for this project, the supplier will start from a suitable existing CPD framework.

The supplier should be an educational organisation that can provide a team of experts who will be expected to work in close collaboration with the Algerian Ministry of National Education and the British Council to ensure appropriate consultation and co-creation at each stage of the project.

The aim is to offer a greater choice of service and also to enhance the availability and accessibility of such services.

Following a successful pilot of the model during 2015 and 2016, the commissioner is looking to award a five year contract for provision of the following service:

Crisis houses provide an innovative approach to care and support for people experiencing serious mental illness who may otherwise require admission to hospital.

Recent evidence from Sweeney et al (2014), found that, ‘therapeutic alliances, service user satisfaction and informal peer support were greater in crisis house environments than on acute wards’.

Crisis houses provide a safe and therapeutic environment for immediate crisis support, whilst remaining focused on on-going recovery, building support networks and preventing future crises.

The Team develops and advises on ORR’s competition and consumer policy, and has an enforcement role in these areas. The Team is also responsible for approving policies and monitoring compliance under passenger-facing licence conditions. 
Access to public transport is for many a necessity of everyday life. As the regulator, we recognise the importance of the rail network being open to everyone regardless of disability. It is our role, via the operating licences, to oversee that the operators of trains and stations enable passengers with a disability to make their journeys easily and confidently, whether those journeys are made independently or with assistance. One of the objectives in our current business plan is therefore to continue to monitor and enforce the obligations operators are accountable for under the terms of their operating licences.
In this context, train and station operators are required by their operating licences to establish and comply with a disabled people’s protection policy (DPPP). A DPPP sets out, amongst other things, the arrangements that an operator will put in place to support disabled people using its services. ORR is responsible for approving and monitoring the implementation of these DPPPs. A key element of DPPPs concerns the requirement that ‘each licensed operator must participate in a reservation system for disabled passengers whose journey begins at any of the stations at which that operator’s trains are scheduled to stop’. That current system is called Passenger Assist. Operators are expected to provide assistance that has been booked through Passenger Assist, at any station during the hours that trains are scheduled to serve that station. As part of our monitoring work we want to increase our evidence base, ensure that obligations in this area are being met and ensure that passengers are satisfied with the service they receive. 
Before we commission work to investigate passengers’ experience of assistance, we would first like to understand disabled people’s awareness of the assistance available to them on the rail network more generally. Our aim is to understand the extent to which current levels of usage reflect genuine demand. Where actual or perceived barriers to access are identified, we wish to explore these to understand how they can be mitigated.

provision (Crisis House), following the same principles of least restrictive care

board, whereby the Authority  (Lancashire Care) would work in partnership with a 
provider in the provision of  two crisis houses for up to six people (each) to stay 
for up to seven nights.   Support will be available to individuals 24 hours per day, 
every day of the year  using a co-produced, person centred recovery approach, 
working closely with  clinical teams.  The service would be accessed via the 
Authority’s Crisis Resolution & Home  Treatment teams (CRHTT) with referral 
facilitated 24/7 by waking night staff  provision. The service will be delivered in a 
home from home environment in a spacious  property including one to one 
support and group work.  Upon leaving the service,  people would be offered 
access to on line therapeutic tools to support their  transition.  The Authority is 
seeking a partner to provide two such ‘Crisis House’ settings in  or conveniently

 The gardens are frequently visited by survivors of the incidents, relatives of the victims and in some cases open to the public. They are all located on Network Rail land spanning various routes and we have a commitment to maintain them. 
 The first garden was built in 2002 in Great Heck near Selby, following the positive response a decision was made to erect ones at Southall, Hatfield and Potters Bar. More recently we have been asked to take over the maintenance of the small memorial site at Porthmadog, Wales. 

 This Contract is for the provision of a maintenance service for the Railway Memorial Gardens to include supplying labour, equipment and the appropriate products to maintain the garden planting, seating, stonework/paving, fencing and safe access at the above sites.
