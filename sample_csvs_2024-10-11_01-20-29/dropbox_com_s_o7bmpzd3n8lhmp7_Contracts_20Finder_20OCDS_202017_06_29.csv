The organic fraction is then treated in our Anaerobic Digester.  
To establish the materials contained in our waste streams and to provide high resolution information Leicester City Council intends to undertake a Waste Composition Analysis (WCA) of 4 key waste streams:
•	Household recycling (orange bag or bin)
•	Household refuse (black bin)
•	Inert stream (waste destine for landfill after processing by the Ball Mill)
•	Floc or RDF (baled waste fraction sent as RDF)
The information gathered on the materials contained within our waste streams, will allow better understanding of the wastes generated in Leicester, the potential to increase recycling rates, and help guide future strategies.

      The original installation comprised two chillers, one being an absorption chiller (CH-21-101) and the second a screw chiller (CH-21-102), in 2012 a third screw chiller (CH-21-103) was installed as part of an earlier, but not entirely successful, remedial works project. The chiller plant has been plagued with poor operational performance which has led the University to obtain capital fund to replace/amend the primary cooling system.
      The scope of works associated with the replacement of the primary cooling system includes the following plant and equipment:
      a. Absorption Chiller (CH-21-101) with integral controls
      b. Screw chiller (CH-21-102) with integral controls
      c. Screw chiller (CH-21-103) with integral controls
      d. Cooling Towers (CTR-25-401 & 402)
      e. Primary Chilled Water Pumps (PMP-21-101, 102 & 103)
      f. Condenser Water Pumps PMP-25-201 & 202.
      g. Pressurisation Unit (MSC-21-101)
      h. Associated trend BEMS controls and condenser water pipework, chilled water pipework up to and including the primary flow and     return headers and any other pipework etc.
      The project shall be to remove all redundant plant and equipment, to install as necessary new plant and equipment and carry out all necessary improvements to retained existing plant and equipment together with all associated builderswork etc. to create a complete new primary chilled water system that delivers chilled water to the low loss header in compliance with this specification and a subsequent associated Service Level Agreement (SLA).
      The Contractor shall be at liberty to reuse and incorporate into the amended installation any or all of the above existing components except for the Trend BEMS installation. The reason for not reusing the existing BEMS being that this will continue to control other existing plant outside of the new SLA.
      The Contractor shall be responsible for ensuring that any reused existing components are suitably repaired/modified/maintained to ensure that they can operate in a suitably reliable and efficient way to meet the conditions of the SLA for operation and maintenance of the primary chilled water system including but not limited to meeting Guaranteed Performance requirements.
      The tender returns will be assessed under a whole life-cycle cost analysis over a 10-year study period. The analysis will include the impact of proposed chiller efficiency at full and part load operation, associated plant (new and retained), maintenance and utility costs. A whole life cycle spreadsheet will be included within the tender documentation for the Contractor to complete. 
      A performance specification and supporting drawings will be provided which outlines a suggested design only with key performance criteria, the tenderers will be encouraged...",,complete,CPV,45331000,"Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning installation work",CPV,51100000,"Installation services of electrical and mechanical equipment",CPV,42500000,"Cooling and ventilation equipment",CPV,45331200,"Ventilation and air-conditioning installation work",CPV,45331100,"Central-heating installation work",CPV,45331230,"Installation work of cooling equipment",,,,,,,,,,1,"SO17 1BJ",,,"South East","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,650000,GBP,,,,,,,,675000,GBP,selective,,"Restricted procedure",2017-04-19T23:59:59+01:00,,2017-06-26T00:00:00+01:00,2022-09-30T23:59:59+01:00,1,,goods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-50103,"University of Southampton","University of Southampton",,,"Highfield, Southampton",Hampshire,"SO17 1BJ","United Kingdom","Catherine Goddard",C.Goddard@soton.ac.uk,"+44 (0)23 8059 8450",http://www.soton.ac.uk,buyer,GB-CFS-60599,"Cooltherm (UK) Ltd.","Cooltherm (UK) Ltd.","Unit 5 Trubodys Yard, Bridgeyate, Bristol, United Kingdom, BS30 5NA",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-50103,"University of Southampton",ocds-b5fd17-13cebbbe-ff99-45f1-b10d-8d5e9b774b71-1,active,2017-06-13T00:00:00+01:00,2017-06-29T15:46:12+01:00,841838.15,GBP,GB-CFS-60599,"Cooltherm (UK) Ltd.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-06-26T00:00:00+01:00,2022-09-30T23:59:59+01:00,,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/93e391a1-dd58-4a46-b9f4-133f17445446,2017-06-29T15:46:12+01:00,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current contract is due to expire in June 2019 and in preparation for the impending tender process we have prepared the enclosed soft market test.

At present the current Waste, Recycling and Street Cleansing Contract provides a service to circa 200,000 households with the Eastbourne Borough Council area receiving weekly residual waste collections and Hastings Borough Council, Rother District Council and Wealden District Council receiving alternate weekly collections (AWC) with all districts receiving AWC kerbside recycling.

Included in this service is a fortnightly, opt-in Garden Waste Service.  The service also includes the delivery of a bulky waste service, residential clinical waste collections and street cleansing.  Hastings and Eastbourne are primarily urban in nature, and Rother and Wealden urban/rural.  The districts also have significant beach areas important for tourism.  

The Council wishes to use to engage with the market and undertake this market engagement exercise to establish the current issues and opportunities facing the market in the delivery of these services and use the results of this exercise to help it shape the future contract.

To clarify, this is a soft market test and not a call for competition or tender opportunity.

We require the contractor/supplier to supply cards and keys to us, so we can supply them, once we receive a void ready for when tag code is received.

We would also require, the company to assist when there are faulty meters.  They will need  to get an engineer to site in a timely manner to resolve the problems, to ensure that the void turnaround  time is not delayed.

The change of supply cannot, delay the letting of a property, as this would affect our turnaround time.

We would require the supplier/company, to ensure that the tenants have freedom to change their supplier, once the property is re-let.

Regular leaks impose an ongoing financial on the university (circa ?30k pa). Complete failure of the system is a growing threat which if realised will have significant impact on operational activities.
      
      To investigate the choices to resolve this issue, Arup were appointed to produce an options appraisal. From these studies it was concluded there are two viable options:
       
      1. Break up the DH Network and introduce distributed gas boilers, or 
      2. Replace the DH Network and introduce a Combined Heat & Power (CHP) plant.
      
      With comparable capital costs, preference was given to option 2 based on the lifecycle benefits, a much more attractive payback period and eligibility for external funding.
      
      The UoC Estates & Property Team now have the need to appoint an M&E Consultant to develop a detailed design of the scheme. This design will form the basis of the Contractor tender documentation. Developing a comprehensive design in a timely fashion will be key to the success of this scheme. A targeted project completion date of late September 2018 ensures timescales are tight across the whole programme.

It will then provide a service to generate and deliver backscatter data from Sentinel 1 imagery.  In order to address the different aspects of the work that are required, the following specification is broken down into a number of modules.  Each will need to be planned and costed separately so that decisions can be taken regarding priorities for the work within available resources.  The modules are:
1.	To carry out a short test by processing one or two Sentinel 1 scenes using 4 different combinations of settings.  The outputs of this test will be presented to stakeholders so that a decision can be taken as to how to modify the processing chain described in Annex B.
2.	To provide a service to generate and deliver imagery from the Sentinel 1 satellite processed into a backscatter product for the UK to the modified specification decided upon following the initial test phase.  This will enable multiple uses of that data and prevent the duplication of that processing.  Once created, that data will be made available for JNCC to ingest via an API into the Defra Collaboration Platform within a fully automated process.  All Sentinel 1A and 1B imagery over the UK from 1st January 2017 to 31st March 2018 will be included in the contract.  This module will also provide a troubleshooting element to ensure that support is available should anything go wrong with technical aspects of the data delivery.
3.	To carry out a detailed technical comparison between the modified version of the processing chain described in Annex B and other proposed standards such as from the CEOS Analysis Ready Data for Land (CARD4L) and the Satellite Applications Catapult.  This will assess the differences between the proposed standards and the likely implications of those differences for users.
4.	To provide a service to generate and deliver imagery from the Sentinel 1 satellite processed into a backscatter product for South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.  This will utilise the same approach as the UK service, but will need refining in order to address issues such as data mode, positional accuracy and coordinate systems to use.
5.	To carry out an assessment of the size of the task and the likely technical difficulties that would be faced in producing Sentinel 1 backscatter for the UK Overseas Territories.  Production of data for these areas is not part of this contract, but the assessment will advise on the best method, to include specifications of projections to be used and to estimate the costs of producing that data.

Additional information: How to apply Instructions to Potential Providers:

Potential Providers must first be registered on the Crown Commercial Service e-Sourcing Suite in order to respond to the Procurement. If you have not yet registered on the e-Sourcing Suite, this can be done online at https://gpsesourcing.cabinetoffice.gov.uk by following the link 'Register for CCS e-Sourcing'.

Please note that, to register, you must have a valid DUNS number (as provided by Dun and Bradstreet) for the organisation which you are registering, who will be entering into a contract if invited to do so at the Invitation to Tender stage. Potential Providers should note that it could take up to 10 working days to obtain a DUNS number.
Full instructions for registration and use of the system can be found at:
http://gps.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/i-am-supplier/respond-tender

Once you have registered on the e-Sourcing Suite, you will need to express your interest by emailing ExpressionOfInterest@Crowncommercial.gov.uk [The dead line for expressing an interest in the Request for Information event is [insert time, day and date (DD/MM/YYYY)]] [Delete if not applicable (ie Open competitions)]

Your email must clearly state:
 - name/reference of this procurement
 - the name of the registered supplier; and
 - the name and contact details

Crown Commercial Service will then process your registration and assign your organisation to the opportunity. The registered user will receive a notification email to alert them once this has been done.

It is advised however that Potential Providers register as soon as practically possible in order to receive the Invitation to Tender and have a sufficient amount of time to respond. Crown Commercial Service is not able to offer any extensions to the advertised procurement timetable.

The equipment will be purchased by BRUNEL.
A pressure filtration cleanliness analyser is required for consistent assessment of Aluminium and Magnesium alloy melts for inclusion content such as refractory contamination and naturally occurring oxide particles and films. Based on the assessment characteristics, capability of the equipment to assess the impact of melt quality on fluidity is also required together with some capability of predicting defect formation during and after mould filling for real castings. The equipment should be a standard fully developed product with capabilities mentioned above, without having the need for us to customise for our needs.

To date, our approach has been to run digital campaigns to drive traffic to the website, increase social engagement, signpost prospects to recruitment events and to raise awareness of vacancies available over the Clearing period. This has helped to create spikes of interest. 

In recognition of the fact that prospective students expect to find the information they need across their media consumption channels of choice at a time that suits them, our approach moving forward is to invest in 'always-on' digital marketing activity aimed at reaching more prospects and maximising opportunities to receive as many high-quality applications as possible. 

Creating a year-round 'push and pull' digital channel mix, providing a combination of awareness, nurturing and direction throughout the consideration journey will be a key differentiator for LJMU in the marketplace.

We are therefore looking to appoint an Agency with proven, first-class expertise in digital marketing to work in partnership with us to deliver a digital marketing strategy that is underpinned by robust analytics and insights to allow us to deliver increasingly targeted marketing communications across a range of platforms

Walsall CCG intends to operate a twelve month pilot with a suitably experienced local nursing home provider (The Lakes) with capacity for the provision of up to six Safe Beds @ a rate of £1,500 per bed per week. This will be with a view to proving concept and within 6 months of operating the pilot the CCG will review the outcomes and if successful in the following six months undertake a procurement for the service with a view to awarding a contract for three years, with an option to extend by a further two.
The successful operator will be in, or in close proximity to, Walsall. 
Providers must operate in a dementia friendly environment with six beds away from existing residents and must also be experienced and currently providing care to people with dementia and behaviour that challenges. Staff skills should be in both dementia and physical health care. 
When tendering the commissioner will assess potential providers through a combination of evaluating tender responses, presentations and site visits to assess the relevance of the provider's experience, the extent of the experience, the suitability of the existing environment, the capability of staff and management arrangements and the track record of outcomes. These will be assessed in equal measure. 
Both the pilot and the tendered service will be provided in accordance with the terms of the 2017-18 NHS Standard Contract (or the latest iteration).

BACKGROUND
In-depth, regular, and independent reviews of leadership and governance are good practice across all industries. Rather than solely assessing the current position of providers in the NHS against the well-led framework, these reviews should identify the areas of leadership and governance of organisations that would benefit from further targeted development work to secure and sustain future improvement.                  

Independent and objective assessment as part of these reviews is vital to safeguard against the optimism bias and group think to which even the best organisations may be susceptible. Our guidance therefore recommends that trusts commission an external supplier to coordinate and facilitate the reviews every 3 - 5 years.  Please see the framework guidance for more details: 
LINK https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/well-led-framework/                                                     

Reviews are likely to take the form of commissioning consultancy firms with expertise across the eight domains of the new well-led framework, published in June 2017.  Assuming an even spread of reviews across the suggested period, there may be c.50 reviews commissioned by individual trusts per year.  

INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE                                                   
As part of increasing the value derived from these reviews, and enhancing the knowledge sharing between providers across the NHS, we are establishing a system of peer review to support trusts in their development and preparing new guidance to promote better practice in commissioning suppliers. 

We would like to explore the questions that arise from this approach to developmental well-led reviews with a range of potential suppliers.  As a supplier, this would give you the opportunity to consider your offering to providers in the NHS in the future, consistent with the new well-led framework and the approach to peer review.

ENGAGEMENT EVENT: 
We are holding a market engagement event to discuss the questions attached to this notice. This will take place in the afternoon on WEDNESDAY 12 JULY 2017 in London. A dial in facility will be available, but in person attendance would be preferred. 

If you would like to attend, please email the names of your delegates (maximum 2 per organisation) to v.partridge@nhs.net BY 5pm on THURSDAY 6 JULY 2017; further details of the meeting will be sent to those who respond by this date.              

If you are not able to attend the meeting, you are welcome to provide written feedback to v.partridge@nhs.net by on 5pm 12 July 2017.

Additional information: NHS Improvement wishes to seek views from suppliers about how we can make sure their engagement enables maximum benefit to be derived from developmental reviews.  


The two key areas for comment are in relation to:
•	Developing new guidance that promotes better practice in commissioning suppliers to deliver effective developmental well-led reviews
•	Embedding peer review as part of the external teams to enable the sharing of experience more widely in the NHS Trust sector.

QUESTIONS TO BE CONSIDERED AT EVENT
In particular, we would like to explore the following questions regarding developmental well-led reviews:
•	What can providers in the NHS do to improve commissioning of reviews leading to improved products that will enhance supplier take-up as well as leading to lasting improvement in the NHS provider sector?  

•	What issues within specifications make it easier for suppliers to deliver an appropriate service; what has been less helpful? 

•	What is your appetite for working with peer reviewers from the NHS? 

•	How would you need to adapt your approach to make use of peer input?

These functions incorporate several interconnected activities:

•	Accessioning - the receipt and logging of archives transferred to Herefordshire Archive and Records Centre (HARC)
•	Cataloguing - describing archives so that they can be accessed
•	Preservation/ conservation - archival storage, packaging and repair of documents

Currently, these processes are carried out by means of disparate paper based systems and general electronic applications. Herefordshire Council is looking to introduce an externally hosted archive management system to bring all these processes together.
