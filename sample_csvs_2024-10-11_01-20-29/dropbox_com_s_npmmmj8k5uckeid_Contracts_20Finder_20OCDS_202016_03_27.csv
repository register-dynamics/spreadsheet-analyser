Newham Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is planning to transform the way that community health services in Newham are delivered.
Community Health Services (CHS) in the borough will be taken through a re-procurement process. As part of this, we are looking to develop a new model of care for our local health care services that is best suited to the future needs of local people. 
As a provider of community services, we would like to invite you to our market engagement event on 11 April in Stratford, London.
We are keen to engage with providers who can work in a partnership approach and support the delivery of outcomes based community health services that can transform the lives of Newham residents. We are seeking providers who have an ambition to transform services and can bring added value to the borough’s health and social care economy.

The market engagement event will present further details of the proposed clinical model, the case for change, procurement timeline, and contracting model for an outcomes based contract.  We also want to hear from providers about their views on our approach and issues that we may need to take into consideration for both the procurement process and delivery of services. This will be in the form of a workshop after a presentation on the vision and model of care. 

The invite is open to any providers who have an interest in community health services and/or are currently in community health services related business. As a provider of care, this represents a unique and early opportunity to share innovation and practices centred around the patient to deliver the outcomes that matter most to patients. The event also provides an opportunity for providers to meet one another and network.

Please note that this is a market testing exercise to inform the organisations’ decision making process, not a call for competition. This does not commit the CCG to carry out a procurement process. Bidders who have expressed an interest in this market testing exercise will have to submit a separate response to the Contract Notice should we decide to procure this service and publish a Contract Notice (advert) for this requirement. 

We are proposing a 3 year contract with 2 year extension commencing in early 2018. All dates stated are variable. The contract value range will be clarified following detailed scoping but is anticipated to be in the range of £100 - £200m over a three year period.

To confirm your participation in the market event on 11 April from 10:00am-12:30pm in Stratford, London, please reply to this email or telephone 0203 688 1543.
