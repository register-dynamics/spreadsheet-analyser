HLF's 2017-18 business plan has made promoting the National Lottery brand and demonstrating the value of heritage as a good cause a corporate priority. This is likely to be endorsed in a forthcoming Corporate Strategy.

The website needs to prioritise: 
•	A strengthened focus on National Lottery players in our communications and advocacy
•	Improving recognition and awareness of the National Lottery while promoting heritage as a TNL good cause, amongst the public 
•	Building on HLF's profile as a sector leader, communicating the impact of our funding

Therefore, to complement those applying for funds or running projects, there needs to be a focus on how we can meaningfully reach and engage the wider public and opinion-formers with an aim of increasing awareness of National Lottery funding for heritage and showcasing the difference heritage makes in people's lives. There is an aspiration to give this audience parity with our applicant/grantee audience.

The research should explore what content these audiences would expect of HLF (if at all) - beyond our remit as a grant-giver aiming to attract and help applicants for funding. It should also recommend how relevant areas of our website should be presented to allow for efficient user journeys.",2017-07-28T11:58:54+01:00,active,CPV,73000000,"Research and development services and related consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"British Oversea Territories",,,"Channel Islands",,Europe,,"Isle of Man",,"Rest of the World",,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,30000,GBP,selective,"Negotiated procedure",2017-08-28T23:59:59+01:00,,2017-09-08T00:00:00+01:00,2017-10-27T23:59:59+01:00,1,,services,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/c1ad6bbd-76a1-4f61-9797-4afeff02a91f,2017-08-14T17:07:21+01:00,text/html,en,3,tenderNotice,,https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/be299f23-b30a-4257-aed0-de900eec4712,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,GB-GOR-PB175,"National Heritage Memorial Fund","National Heritage Memorial Fund",GB-GOR,PB175,"HOLBEIN PLACE",LONDON,"SW1W 8NR",England,"Tom Scott",tom.scott@hlf.org.uk,,http://HLF.org.uk,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-PB175,"National Heritage Memorial Fund",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HLF209","HLF HERITAGE GRANTS OUTCOME REVIEW","We wish to conduct an evaluation of the Heritage Grants projects funded under HLF's 3rd Strategic Plan (SP3), which ran from December 2008 to March 2013. Under SP3 HLF awarded over £964m to 777 Heritage Grants, ranging in size from £50,000 to over £5m. Of these 777 projects, 375 are now complete.

This study will involve a comprehensive review of the self-evaluation reports and the outcomes achieved by 150-175 Heritage Grants projects completed since July 2016, and which were funded under SP3. There are three key tasks:
a)	To assess the quality of the 150-175 completed project self-evaluations, using the methodology and grading developed from a prior evaluation of 200 completed projects - see https://www.hlf.org.uk/about-us/research-evaluation/programme-evaluation/review-grantee-evaluations. 
b)	To use the self-evaluations, alongside other assessment and monitoring material, to establish the range and success of activities and outcomes achieved by SP3 Heritage Grants projects, and to map these findings onto HLF's outcomes framework that has been in use since 2012. 
c)	To build on the Excel dataset already developed as part of the prior review of 200 self-evaluations, both enabling the results to be aggregated with this study, as well as for comparison between the two studies.

The studies are expected to:  Identify two value chains in each country which offer the best potential to increase economic opportunities for smallholder farmers, using the selection criteria described in paragraph 3 below;
Identify potential interventions within the recommended value chains which the programme could make to develop commercial agriculture in line with the CASA objectives and approach. The studies will identify opportunities to: 
Establish, support or expand smallholder aggregation and access to markets, particularly for poorer farmers, women and those not currently engaged in commercial agriculture. 
Support SME agribusinesses with significant smallholder supply chains to prepare for and attract early stage investment; 
Support organisations which bring together stakeholders to advocate for regulatory reform and identify possible reforms which would boost growth in the value chain and increase the ability of smallholders to participate in it.",,complete,CPV,75211200,"Foreign economic-aid-related services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"British Oversea Territories",,,"Channel Islands",,Europe,,"Isle of Man",,"Rest of the World",,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,344575,GBP,selective,"Negotiated procedure",2017-06-22T23:59:59+01:00,,2017-07-03T00:00:00+01:00,2017-09-30T23:59:59+01:00,1,1,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-124,"DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT","DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT",,,"Department for International Development (DFID), Abercrombie House, Eaglesham Road","East Kilbride","G75 8EA",Scotland,"Public Enquiry Point",enquiry@dfid.gov.uk,"+44 (0)1355 843132",https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development,buyer,GB-CFS-48066,"IMC Worldwide Ltd.","IMC Worldwide Ltd.","64 - 68 London Road

The catering service provision at the above six schools has not been market tested in recent years and to ensure best value principles are applied the Headteachers and school sponsors / governors of each school have made a decision to tender their catering services.

County Bridge Primary, Old Church and St Joseph's all have production kitchens on site. However, the other three schools will require a delivered-in food service and this should be taken into account when considering to tender for this project. It is expected all food served to pupils and staff will be freshly prepared on a daily basis including the delivered food option.

All six schools are in a radius of three miles of each other, thus making the logistics of managing the contract straightforward.

Current pupil roll numbers across all six sites is circa 1773:

- County Bridge Primary School: 204 pupils and 39 staff; annual turnover circa 45 000 GBP;

- Pool Hayes Primary School: 210 pupils and 38 staff; annual turnover circa 50 000 GBP;

- Old Church CofE Primary School: 360 pupils and 50 staff; annual turnover circa 60 000 GBP per annum

- Salisbury Primary School: 345 pupils and 40 staff; annual turnover circa 90 000 GBP per annum

- Pinfold Street Primary School: 418 pupils and 50 staff; annual turnover circa 64 000 GBP;

- St Joseph's Catholic Primary School: 236 pupils and 49 staff; annual turnover circa 40 000 GBP.

Current turnover value across all six locations is circa 350 000 GBP per annum including Free School Meals. Current uptake levels across all sites average out at circa 60 % and the schools firmly believe that with improved choice and quality there is a real opportunity to increase this level of uptake.

For the avoidance of doubt TUPE Regulations will apply to this contract and some of the current catering staff are in the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS).

County Bridge Primary School have their own arrangement in place with a contractor and Old Church, Salisbury, Pinfold Street and St Joseph's use another contractor. Pool Hayes' catering provision is currently managed by Walsall DSO.

The successful contractor will be expected to deliver a concise and detailed method of management reporting at the end of each month, thus updating the schools on contract performance. It is imperative that an open book policy is offered to ensure that each school has total clarity on financial performance.

The Cluster schools are seeking both innovation and the application of current food trends within the tender submissions and would expect as a result of this to be able to identify 'best value' and work in partnership with their chosen contractor going forward.

Sharnbrook Academy Federation (SAF) is a Multi-Academy Trust (MAT) based in rural North Bedfordshire. Formed in 2011 by the Federation of three schools; Sharnbrook Upper School, Lincroft Middle school and Harrold Middle school. In 2013, an additional school Margaret Beaufort Middle school joined the Federation. Recently, two more schools, Harrold Lower and Oakley Lower School joined in November 2016. The 6 schools between them serve an age range from Reception through to 18 years, some 3 200 students.

The contract being tendered will be awarded on a 3 + 2 years basis, subject to satisfactory performance and reviews. The end date is timed to coincide with the end of other outsourced services. The contract will run from 1.8.2017.

Due to the change to age ranges, the following is expected to occur:

Sharnbrook will operate as an 11 to 18 school and will for 1 year increase its number on roll to 2 200 before falling back to around 1 950.

Lincroft will become a secondary school, ages 11-16 and will increase in size in increments of 200 until a capacity of around 1 000 is reached.

Harrold Priory will close with the Lower school expanding to become a single form of entry primary school for age 4-11 years of around 200 children. There will be a period of 1 year from September 2017 when the number on roll will be 300.

Margaret Beaufort School will close and as a result does not form part of this tender.

A new build Primary school, Great Ouse will open in Bedford.

In the background, there are ongoing discussions with other academies with the intention of forming a larger group. The successful contractor will be given the opportunity to be involved in this expansion.

Contract:

The contract being tendered will be awarded on a 3 + 2 years basis, subject to satisfactory performance and reviews. The end date is timed to coincide with the end of other outsourced services.

The school year is based on a calendar of 195 days. 5 days are to be used for staff professional development which means that each School will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days.

The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all catering services, including vending, within the schools, which currently includes breakfast, morning break, lunch, all hospitality and free issue requirements. Free School Meals, nursery meals and hospitality will be charged based on consumption and at net food cost.

In the last 20 years, the rail industry has seen continued growth, journey numbers have doubled, and this has allowed the proportion of subsidy from government to be reduced over time. However, there are now early signs that this is beginning to change. Whilst still growing, passenger revenue in the last year increased by 2.5%, compared to an average over the last 20 years of 6.8%. With total passenger revenue amounting to approximately £9.5Bn annually, the change can have large implications on passenger operator franchising agreements and ultimately on the Treasury's budget. Whilst this decline in growth can, at least in part, be explained by traditional economic factors, such as a GDP, fuel prices and rail fairs, the change is larger than forecasts using best practises for the rail industry. 
It is hypothesised, that these unexpected differences are a manifestation of the major and rapid changes facing our society, which are starting to have an important role in travel demand. A scoping study commissioned by RSSB and carried out by KPMG has explored a long list of current and future trends that could impact rail, and identified six major themes that have the potential to make a significant impact on both travel demand in general and on rail's competitive position within the domestic travel marketplace. These key themes are:
1.	Changes to the structure of the economy (e.g. flexible working, automation)
2.	Socio-demographic structure (e.g. aging population, urbanisation)
3.	Alternatives and substitutes to travel (e.g. virtualisation, 3D printing) 
4.	Price, quality and availability of transport (e.g. autonomous vehicles, hyperloop)
5.	Integration between modes (e.g. personalisation, mobility as a service)
6.	Policy and regulation (e.g. demand management and charging, regulation)
This qualitative study has made recommendations for the next steps industry could take to develop an approach to understanding the key drivers that impact travel choice, including:
•	A further exploration of the key themes identified, utilising existing data sources and analytical methods to quantitively assess their range of expected impacts and associated timescales.
•	Building a better picture of the trade-offs that customers make by:
o	Understanding travel choice at an individual level, utilising technology to collect better information about a passenger's specific end to end journey choices.",,planning,CPV,66171000,"Financial consultancy services",CPV,73000000,"Research and development services and related consultancy services",CPV,79300000,"Market and economic research; polling and statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"EC2M 2RB",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-OT1207,"RAIL SAFETY AND STANDARDS BOARD LIMITED","RAIL SAFETY AND STANDARDS BOARD LIMITED",GB-GOR,OT1207,"The Helicon",London,"EC2M 2RB",England,"R&D Business Partner",Shareditt@rssb.co.uk,,,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-OT1207,"RAIL SAFETY AND STANDARDS BOARD LIMITED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

- The Littlehampton Academy.

- Sir Robert Woodard Academy.

The Littlehampton Academy (TLA) and The Sir Robert Woodard Academy (SRWA) are 11-18 academies within the Woodard Academies Trust (WAT) group of academies. Both academies opened in 2009, having transferred from the West Sussex local authority, and both moved into brand new state-of-the-art buildings in 2012. Both academies are close to award-winning beaches on the south coast of England. The academies believe that success should be celebrated and that pupils should enjoy their time at school; if the classroom environment supports stimulating lessons then students will love learning. Much importance is therefore placed on the environment including the cleanliness of the academies to support the needs of all students.

TLA has places for 1 900 students including a thriving sixth form. As a Christian-designated academy, TLA provides a diverse culture enabling young people from all faiths and none to flourish.

TLA has outstanding teaching facilities set in 48 acres of landscaped grounds. The Academy has floor area of 14 256 m2.

The contract being tendered is for 3 years in duration from 1.8.2017 to 31.7.2020 with an option for the academies to extend by a further 2 years. The submitted tender should be for either or both academies.

For the purposes of the contract, the academy year is based on 39 weeks which form 'term time'. A reduced schedule including deep cleans will be required for non-term time.

The scope of the contract(s) offered includes the provision of all cleaning services within the academy which currently includes:

- Main building;

- Sports Hall;

- Science block;

- Compass Centre;

- Sixth Form Centre;

- Library.

The academy uses staff employed by the academy and also uses a cleaning contractor. Cleaning is carried out at the end of the school day with some light housekeeping through the day. Contract cleaning work into the night.

Whilst the academy prioritises value for money as a key objective of the competitive tender process, the Client is not obliged to accept the lowest price. Consideration will be given to the locality of the business, the ability to dispense the requirements of the contract and the record of supporting and or improving the standards of cleaning.

The academy expects that the successful tenderer should evidence, through their bid, how they shall support and complement their values and support the principles of the academy.

Additional information: Interest in the selection process should be expressed via email only to pqq@litmuspartnership.co.uk clearly stating within this email which contract / notice you are referring to.

The catering service provision at the School has been operated 'in-house' and has not been market tested for many years. To ensure Best Value principles are applied the School have made a decision to tender the catering service.

The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine is a world-leading centre for research and post-graduate education in public and global health, with over 4 000 students and more than 1 000 staff working in 100 countries. The School's mission is to improve health and health equity in the UK and worldwide; working in partnership to achieve excellence in public and global health research, education and translation of knowledge into policy and practice.

There is approximately 1 000 full-time students, 3 000 distance learner students and 1 000 students on short courses. The School offers a refectory style service in Keppel Street to the students and staff on site only. Current turnover is 325 000 GBP per annum. The refectory is open 8:00 - 16:00 Monday-Friday. It also offers significant amounts of hospitality in the building. There is a licensed bar which opens on a Friday evening with a current turnover of 15 000 GBP per annum.

The coffee shop in Tavistock Place has been previously leased to another operator. From the start of this contract the coffee shop in Tavistock Place will be included in the tender. The School is expecting this open to the staff / students and the general public 7 days a week.

There are currently 9 staff working full-time in the catering department, employed by the School, and 1 person eligible to transfer under TUPE in Tavistock Square. These staff will transfer under TUPE to the successful contractor.

The School will be commencing a building project to the Tavistock Square coffee shop and bar area in Keppel Street to improve the facility in time for the commencement of the contract. The School does not anticipated any financial contribution from the successful contractor; it is looking for considerable input in the design and style of service.

The School is ISO 14001 and EcoCampus Platinum certified; it is important that any contractor be similarly certified.

The School wishes to offer healthy eating options within the menu with minimal use of disposables. The menu should be based on the use of fresh ingredients and bakery products.

Working with the local community is something that the School strives to do at all times and to this end we would like to ensure that all your fresh produce is sourced from local suppliers (within a 20 mile radius of the School): details should be included within your submission.

Schools within the Partnership Learning Trust:

- Sydney Russell Primary School
- Sydney Russell Secondary School
- Riverside Primary School
- Riverside Secondary School
- Riverside Community Special School
- Greatfields School

There is an additional school included within this project that is looking to benefit from opportunities of scale passed on from a single contracted solution across the service delivery, that is outside of the Trust and will form a separate contract:

- Dagenham Park Church of England School

The contract being tendered is for three years in duration from 1 August 2017 to 31 July 2020 and will be a 3+2 contract. The contract will operate as a guaranteed performance contract, with the successful Contractor offering the Client a guaranteed return / cost per annum for the provision of catering services.

The tender project is seeking to appoint a Contractor whose initiative and innovation will be welcomed for the provision of service within the existing facilities with a focus on exciting new food concepts to satisfy a wide range of pupil tastes and dietary requirements. The School would wish the successful contractor to review the current range of services offered and make recommendations accordingly.

The contract being tendered is for three years in duration from 1.8.2017 to 31.7.2020 and will be a 3+2 contract. The contract will operate as a guaranteed performance contract, with the successful Contractor offering the Client a guaranteed return / cost per annum for the provision of catering services. Sovereignty of the cash tariff is to remain with all schools, for the duration of this contract.

The academic year is based on a calendar of 195 days. 5 days are to be used for staff professional development which means that School will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days.

The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all catering services within the schools, which currently includes morning break, lunch, all hospitality and free issue requirements. Free School Meals and hospitality will be charged based on consumption and at net food cost.

Whilst the Client prioritises value for money as a key objective of the competitive tender process, the Client is not obliged to accept the lowest price.

All schools within these contracts expect the successful contractor to enable the continued development of catering through the provision of an innovative, healthy food service, with fresh, seasonal, locally sourced ingredients being prepared on-site. The Client expects the successful tenderer to evidence, through their bid, how they shall support and complement their values.

- Newcastle Academy ~ ST5 2QY

- Clayton Hall Academy ~ ST5 3DN

- Bantock Primary School ~ WV3 0HY

http://www.bantockprimaryschool.co.uk/

S4S have been commissioned by the Cluster to coordinate this project to ensure best value principles are achieved. The Litmus Partnership are working in partnership with S4S to manage the tender process and to assist with protocols that need to be in place throughout the tender management process.

The catering services provision at all seven schools has not been market tested in recent years and to ensure best value principles are applied the Headteachers and School Sponsors / Governors of each school have made a decision to tender their catering services.

All schools have their own kitchen facilities and it is expected all food served to students will be freshly prepared and produced on site.

Current pupil roll numbers across all seven sites is circa 3 274:

- Newcastle Academy ~ 383;

- Clayton Hall Academy ~ 980;

- Sir Thomas Boughey High School ~ 608;

- Merridale Primary School ~ 173;

- Lanesfield Primary School ~ 353;

- Uplands Junior School ~ 380;

- Bantock Primary School ~ 397 including Reception.

Current turnover value across all seven locations is circa 630 000 GBP per annum including Free School Meals. Current uptake levels across all sites average out at circa 60 % and the schools firmly believe that with improved choice and quality there is a real opportunity to increase this level of uptake, especially across the Wolverhampton schools.

For the avoidance of doubt TUPE Regulations will apply to this contract and some of the current catering staff are in the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS). Both Newcastle Academy and Clayton Hall Academy currently manage their catering services with an in-house operation; all the Wolverhampton schools currently use the local DSO. The catering service provision at Sir Thomas Boughey High School is currently operated by an external catering contractor.

Please note: Although this project is being advertised as a single lot contract each School, at its own discretion, will have the option of awarding the contract to its preferred bidder.

The aim of this early market engagement exercise is also to gauge potential interest in this contract opportunity and field for innovative proposals to improve the current drafted service specification (attached). Please also find attached a Memorandum of Information (MOI) & Market Engagement Questionnaire (MEQ).

The aim of the service is to provide a range of community step-down services for people that have been discharged from forensic and/or secure care. This cohort of service users may have enduring mental health needs and ongoing issues with substance misuse and non-compliance.

The service objective is to work collaboratively with a range of professionals to provide a rehabilitation environment that supports the service user with safely transitioning through the different levels of care. 

The service is responsive to the changing needs of the users, enabling them to move towards recovery while assisting them to manage their health needs and achieve future independence.

The service will provide a tiered range of community provision to manage the different level of treatment needs, which will ensure:
  
•	Relapse and re-admission is kept to a minimum
•	Independence, recovery and social inclusion are promoted wherever possible
•	Improved quality of life through the improvement of social and emotional functioning and material and physical well-being are achieved for all service users

The expected 3 (with a possible extension of 2 years; totalling 5 years) contract value will be circa £1,100,000 per annum. 

Expressions of interest are now invited by way of completion and return of the attached Market Engagement Questionnaire by close of play, Wed 23rd August 2017.

Participation in the engagement exercise is not a mandatory requirement for participating in any potential future procurement; however, responses received will assist to inform the Commissioner as to the level of interest from the market and will be used to evidence a decision as to whether or not to undertake a competitive procurement.  CONFIRMATION OF YOUR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT.

Sir Frederic Osborn School is a secondary school in Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. On 1.3.2017, the school converted to foundation status. The school is currently considering converting to become an Academy.

The tender project is seeking to appoint a Supplier whose initiative and innovation will be welcomed for the provision of service within the existing facilities for the 598 students on roll and 108 teaching and support staff, with a focus on exciting new food concepts to satisfy a wide range of pupil tastes and dietary requirements. The Client would wish the successful Supplier to review the current range of services offered and make recommendations accordingly.

The contract being tendered is for three years in duration from 1.8.2017 to 31.7.2020 and will operate as a guaranteed performance contract, with the successful Supplier offering the Client a guaranteed return / cost per annum for the provision of catering services. Sovereignty of the cash tariff is to remain with the Client for the duration of this contract.

The academic year is based on a calendar of 195 days. Five days are to be used for staff professional development which means that School will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days.

The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all catering services within the school, which currently includes morning break, lunch, all hospitality and free issue requirements. Hospitality will be charged based on consumption and at net food cost and Free School Meals will be charged on uptake.

Whilst the Client prioritises value for money as a key objective of the competitive tender process, the governing body is not obliged to accept the lowest price.

The Client expects the successful Supplier to enable the continued development of catering through the provision of an innovative, healthy food service, with fresh, seasonal, locally sourced ingredients being prepared on-site. The Client expects the successful tenderer to evidence, through their bid, how they shall support and complement its values and support the principles of Every Child Matters.

The Client believes that success should be celebrated and that pupils should enjoy their time at school; if lessons are stimulating and challenging then students will love learning. Much time therefore, is spent reviewing and planning schemes of work to ensure that they are differentiated to meet the needs of all students. As a result, the Client is very enthusiastic regarding work experience and apprenticeship proposals and would welcome the input of the successful Supplier.

The report should follow desk-based research and interviews and include a series of recommendations aimed at helping scope the AHDB vision and shaping our future role with data. A feedback meeting may be required to discuss the recommendations.  

The report should cover, at a minimum, the following areas: 

-	How is the agricultural landscape changing as the result of big data and technological advances in data capture and management such as AI & blockchain? How will these trends continue to change over the next 3 -5 years?

-	To what extent are farmers, processors and retailers using big data and related technological advances at the moment? How might they take advantage of potential applications in the future?

-	How does AHDB effectively communicate the role of big data, its usefulness and limitations to the industry as well as encouraging, championing and supporting the industry's participation in big data projects?

-	How can AHDB work alongside the Government's Centres for Agriculture Innovation and other commercial organisations to:

-	Become partners and advocacies in projects/initiatives that will add the most value for levy payers?
-	Establish which projects and opportunities AHDB should lead on and/or drive to add the most value for levy payers?
-	Discover the practical tools farmers' would most likely benefit from?
-	Reduce data fragmentation and effectively join data sources?

-	How does the availability of ""big data"" impact on AHDB's current offer? How will this change by 2025?

-	What are the hurdles and risks AHDB and the industry will face when working in a ""big data"" world (e.g. commercial confidentiality, data protection limitations etc)?

Participation may be either by direct participation in the Joint Venture or through the provision of services, works or supplies by the Joint Venture. EBC wants to respond to the energy sector's trilemma of increasing prices, future shortage of supply, and the need to reduce carbon emissions. EBC also wants to be prepared for the challenges and uncertainty the food chain will face when major global food regions are under threat from extreme weather patterns. The JV arrangement may involve services, works or supplies being developed and delivered and commercial opportunities taken forward over the next 20 - 30 years in a number of sectors: Energy, Transport Food, Waste and Water. The main place of performance will be the geographic areas of Kent, Surrey, Brighton and Hove, East Sussex and West Sussex (the 'JV Areas') but may extend to the UK over the life of the joint venture. A Contract Award Notice has been published in OJEU (reference 2017/S 154-320093).

Additional information: Estimated Total Value: The value and scope of the joint venture arrangement will be subject to the development of the projects under the Strategic Partnership Agreement and the inclusion of other participants as outlined in the Contract Notice and the MOI. Although not guaranteed, the estimated value of the arrangements with the participation of EBC is in the region of 500 000 000 GBP (five hundred million). Although not guaranteed the estimated value of the arrangement during the life of the joint venture including other participants across the UK may extend to an estimated value of approximately 50 000 000 000 GBP (fifty billion).

The School is seeking both innovation and the application of current security techniques and up-to-date equipment within the tender submissions and would expect as a result of this to be able to identify 'best value' principles and work in partnership with the chosen contractor going forward.

The College has five key objectives which should be focused upon throughout the tender process. They are:

Ongoing savings year-on-year during the contract term.

This procurement of an ITLA is in line with Hackney Council's commitment to involve residents in decisions made about their homes and is also good practice.

The role of an ITLA is to provide independent and impartial advice to residents, so that they can fully interact and play an informed role in the regeneration of their homes and the surrounding estate. The ITLA must be independent from, and not seen as, representing the views of the Council, or any prospective new landlord or development partner. It is an advisory role, focused on regeneration activities.

Pyroguard UK Limited.
Overview:
Pyroguard are the world's leading independent manufacturers of fire rated glass with
factories in Haydock, UK and Seingbouse, France. The sales team of approximately 20
persons are located across Europe in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain and France and
the business is now of a size where there is a need to build efficiency into the quotation
process to allow further development. To do this the business will be implementing a CPQ
(Configure, Price, and Quote) package that will automate the process and greatly assist the
sales team.
Requirements:
The CPQ tool must integrate seamlessly with our CRM system and therefore it is highly
likely that the Salesforce product (previously known as Steelbrick) would be the chosen one.
Consultancy is required to configure the system to our business, products and processes but
the key features will be
 Configuration of requirements based off Pyroguard certification
 Capture of additional services and products that can be supplied
 Calculation of the margin for the opportunity
 Authorisation of the offer against a sign off matrix
 Distribution of the offer to the customer along with supporting documents
Deliverable Timescale:
Project to commence October 2017 and be completed within 3 months.
Estimated Budget
The work will be part funded through European Regional Development Fund.
We estimate that the project falls within the £2,500 - £24,999 bracket and therefore, under
Current Public Procurement Regulations, there is no formal tender procedure but a detailed
Written quotation is required.
Proposal Format:
Proposals should clearly demonstrate how they meet the requirement set out above.
Deadlines and Submission:
Proposals for consideration are required by: 5.00pm on 31st August 2017 either
electronically or by post to:

The aim of this early market engagement exercise is also to gauge potential interest in this contract opportunity and field for innovative proposals to improve the current drafted service specification (attached). Please also find attached an MOI & Questionnaire.

The aim of the service is to provide a range of community step-down services for people that have been discharged from forensic and/or secure care. This cohort of service users may have enduring mental health needs and ongoing issues with substance misuse and non-compliance.

The service objective is to work collaboratively with a range of professionals to provide a rehabilitation environment that supports the service user with safely transitioning through the different levels of care. 

The service is responsive to the changing needs of the users, enabling them to move towards recovery while assisting them to manage their health needs and achieve future independence.

The service will provide a tiered range of community provision to manage the different level of treatment needs, which will ensure:
  
•	Relapse and re-admission is kept to a minimum
•	Independence, recovery and social inclusion are promoted wherever possible
•	Improved quality of life through the improvement of social and emotional functioning and material and physical well-being are achieved for all service users

The expected 3 (with a possible extension of 2 years; totalling 5 years) contract value will be circa £1,100,000 per annum. 

Expressions of interest are now invited by way of completion and return of the attached Market Engagement Questionnaire by 3pm, 18th August 2017.

Participation in the engagement exercise is not a mandatory requirement for participating in any potential future procurement; however, responses received will assist to inform the Commissioner as to the level of interest from the market and will be used to evidence a decision as to whether or not to undertake a competitive procurement.  CONFIRMATION OF YOUR EXPRESSION OF INTEREST IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT.

Additional information: Please help to return this questionnaire by no later than 3pm Friday 18th August 2017 to Sian Kirk (Sian.Kirk@croydonccg.nhs.uk) & Jennifer Francis (jennifer.francis@swlondon.nhs.uk).
