The Provision of the Core+ 2 Service consists of seven themes, with each theme containing sub indicators, of which can be viewed within the Service Specification located on the EU-Supply Portal. The Contracting Authority seeks responses from interested Providers who wish to deliver the Service as set out in the Service Specification. Interested Providers must complete and submit a Qualification Questionnaire (QQ). Providers are asked to indicate their proposed bidding model within their QQ response. Where Bidder Members are involved in the proposed model they should also complete the required sections of the QQ. Full details of this can be found in the Bidder Instruction Document. All documents are available electronically via EU Supply - https://nhssbs.eu-supply.com. Please see the QQ Bidder Instruction Document for an overview of the procurement process. The QQ includes Grounds for Exclusion, Economic and Financial Standing and Technical and Professional Ability including:
- Contract Specific Technical Questions: A series of scored questions under the criteria of: (1) Deliverability; (2) Quality; (3) Integration and Transformation; and (4) Organisational Sustainability. Some questions ask Bidders to refer to previous experience. Other questions ask Bidders to explain their understanding of local requirements for the Core+2 Service and in some instances their proposed approach to delivery of the Service. This flexibility of approach is utilised as permitted under the 'light touch regime'.
- Standard Technical Questions: A series of Pass/Fail questions dealing with aspects relevant to service provision, for example, CQC Registration, Insurances, Regulatory etc. This will be a Qualification Stage followed by an Award Stage. The Award Stage will involve invitation of proposals which will be evaluated against award criteria and is also likely to include strategic dialogue. Further information will be provided in due course. The contract will be awarded without further advertisement of this opportunity and there will be no further opportunity to express interest. The indicative affordability threshold is £7,400,000 per annum and the Contract will be for a duration of 3 years. The QQ documentation should be completed and submitted by 5pm on 20th December 2017.",2017-11-21T23:30:24Z,active,CPV,85000000,"Health and social work services",CPV,85100000,"Health services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"North West","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,GBP,,,,,,,22200000,GBP,,"Other - ",2017-12-20T23:59:59Z,,2018-04-01T00:00:00+01:00,2021-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/4315e851-d225-4e89-b012-b9bcf8723d36,2017-11-21T23:30:24Z,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-37879,"NHS Shared Business Services Ltd (NHS SBS)","NHS Shared Business Services Ltd (NHS SBS)",,,"3rd Floor Number One Riverside, Smith Street, Rochdale",Rochdale,"OL16 1XU",ENG,"Rachael Frank",rachael_frank@nhs.net,"+44 1612123714",,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-37879,"NHS Shared Business Services Ltd (NHS SBS)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Contract Number: 12660
      
      It is considered that the 20 Storey tower block is no longer suitable and the site is earmarked for redevelopment, therefore identifies the need for safe demolition and site clearance. Explosive demolition and high reach demolition are options being considered for this demolition project.

      Contractors wishing to tender for this contract must have 3 years of audited accounts showing a minimum annual average turnover of £2.5 Million.

      Contract 2011 for explosive demolition both issued by the Joint Contracts Tribunal with Birmingham City Council amendments.
      
      It is anticipated the works will commence in May 2017 and be completed by November 2017.

We deliver access for all of our collections for information, learning and enjoyment to make sure archives survive so that future generations will be able to do the same.

Cheshire Archives and Local Studies is headquartered at the Cheshire Record Office in Chester, where it has been based since 1985. The building is no longer fit-for-purpose as storage conditions and space do not meet current standards and accommodation for staff, volunteers and public falls below current expectations. Increasingly its suitability is being questioned on health and safety grounds.
Elected members in both authorities have approved the development of a delivery model for the service which sees two new History Centres being developed as bases for the service. One will be a 'headquarters' building in Chester and the second facility will be in Crewe. Sites were allocated to the project in September 2017 and both facilities will be new build. Funding has been secured to develop a First Round Heritage Lottery Fund grant application around this delivery model. It is anticipated that a HLF grant application will be in the region of £4 million and to this end a First Round submission is expected be submitted in early 2018. The Councils are therefore seeking a range of consultancy services to support the preparation of this application, namely:
-	Activity Planning
-	Interpretation and Exhibition

The core services impacted are Finance, Procurement, Human Resources and Payroll. The Framework Agreement will commence on 22.9.2017 for a period of 4 years. Individual call off contracts awarded under the Framework Agreement is for an initial term of 7 years with the option to extend for a further period(s) up to a maximum extension of 5 years. Both Authorities entered into a call off contract under the Framework on the same day as the award. In addition to the Authorities, Warrington Borough Council, Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council, Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council and Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council are entitled, but not obliged, to call off services. The 4 Year Framework Agreement is awarded to a single supplier which was entered into by Cheshire East Council. The call-off contracts under the Framework Agreement are for an initial term of 7 years with the option to extend for 1 or more periods of up to 5 years. The value of the Framework Agreement is estimated to be approximately 42-50 000 000 GBP but will be dependent on the Authorities and Related Councils' decision whether to use the Framework Agreement. Owing to the size/nature of the services and help to ensure the best service continuity, the Authorities have decided not to subdivide the contract services into Lots. The scope includes the implementation of modules offering improved functionality and solution refreshes during the term.

No guarantee or warranty has been given as to the nature or volume of the Services or the number of call offs under the Framework Agreement. The values given in this notice are only estimations and are for the initial 7 year contract period and also take into account the extension option of up to a further 60 months.

Note : Please disregard any content in this notice that requests your organisation to ""apply directly to the buyer"" as this, unfortunately, is a system generated error, that is outside of the Contracting Authority's control   

All tender information MUST be submitted through the CCS eSourcing Portal.

Brief Description of Requirement

National Oceanography Centre (NOC) is seeking interest from qualified engineering firms to undertake the combined roles of Principle Contractor and Designer for the professional services associated with the above Design & Build project. This contract will be awarded subject to NEC3 Engineering and Construction Contract (ECC) Terms and Conditions.  

The Joseph Proudman building is located at 6 Brownlow Street, Liverpool L3 5DA.

The motorised window opening chain box system was installed as part of the original build on floors two, three and four and is circa 12 years old. The control system, Window Master, for the motorised windows is closed protocol and independent of the main Building Management System, Siemens Desigo Insight.
The window control protocol is informed by wall mounted room sensors and the primary control parameters are internal temperature and CO2 levels. In addition the system includes a roof mounted weather station which allows for heavy rain/high wind control functions.  It has been observed that the under control system often 'fights' the heating system in the summer resulting in overheating of the building and increased heat consumption. 

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the RFx attachments tab within the Emptoris System. 
As part of the Principal Contractor Tender Process - The bidders are recommended to attend a site visit on site. This will consist of a conducted tour of the building and its services, and the access to and from Reception. Tenderers wishing to attend will be required to contact UK SBS via the e-Sourcing Portal advising of the names and vehicle registrations of those wishing to visit at least 48 hours before the commencement.

Additional information: DO NOT APPLY DIRECTLY TO BUYER

All submissions will be assessed in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015, for procurement values that exceed Regulation 5 (Threshold amounts) 
 
Responses must be received by the date in the bid documents.

Responses received outside or concurrently using the eSourcing process will not be accepted or considered further for this opportunity.
