The GEIC equipment fund is part financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) funds having been awarded under the 2014-2020 Priority Axis 1: Promoting Research and Innovation.

The equipment is being purchased for the Graphene Engineering and Innovation Centre (""GEIC"") at the University of Manchester.  The GEIC is a £60 million investment which will establish a state of the art research and technology development facility for graphene and related 2D materials.  Projects in the GEIC will be industry-led and will focus on innovation and applications, with the aim of accelerating research through to products in the marketplace. The GEIC will house pilot production facilities and characterisation equipment. It will initially focus on a number of the University's world-class graphene application areas: energy, composites, formulations and coatings, electronics and membranes.

Given the world leading graphene research at the University, it is expected that all the equipment in the GEIC will be cited in high profile academic publications as well as underpinning industrial collaboration projects, thus giving the equipment a high degree of exposure.
The GEIC will be situated on the North Campus of The University of Manchester, comprise of ~8400 m2 and has been designed by world-renowned architect Rafael Viñoly. It is set to be open in summer 2018. Equipment purchased before the GEIC building is opened will be temporally commissioned elsewhere in the University campus, typically in the National Graphene Institute, and then moved into the GEIC once it is completed.

The aim is to give school pupils and their families the confidence, skills and knowledge they need to cook, grow and enjoy good quality, affordable food, as well as increasing their understanding of where their food comes from. The programme should use food as a way to engage the community and improve the whole school experience, making lunchtimes a positive feature of the day and enriching classroom learning with farm visits and practical cooking and growing. Ultimately the aim of the programme is to give schools the tools they need to make long term changes to their food culture and their curriculum to support healthy behaviours.  The programme will be available to every school in Leicestershire, but with the main focus on  primary and Special (SEN) schools. The Programme will work in partnership with the County Council and Public Health team to deliver this programme as part of the Leicestershire Healthy Schools Programme. The contract is being offered for an initial period of 12 months, with the option to extend for up to a further 24 months.

The framework will be split into 2 lots. Lot 1 will meet individual project requirements ranging in cost from 250 000 GBP to 1 000 000 GBP and Lot 2 in the cost range > 1 000 000 GBP to 5 000 000 GBP. All contractors appointed to the framework agreement must be able to undertake projects to the upper project cost limit within the lot tendered for. It is intended to award places on each lot of the framework agreement to 8 contractors. Interested contractors will be able to apply for one or both lots. The anticipated total financial value of works to be put through the framework agreement over the duration of the framework is estimated to be in the region of 50 000 000 GBP, however this will be dependent on funds made available through Wigan Council's capital investment programme. Wigan Council does not guarantee any volumes or specific values of work to be placed under the framework. Individual contracts raised under the framework agreement can commence at any time after the commencement date of the framework. The construction work will be predominantly school build works however Wigan Council reserves the right to use the framework for other more general requirements when necessary. There will be potential for partner organisations or other areas of the Council to use the framework e.g. academies, the diocese, WLCT.

Each requirement for work identified requiring use of the framework will be tendered to all the suitable framework contractors in the form of mini competitions. The time limit set for responses will vary, but will take into account the complexity of requirements and time needed to prepare and submit responses in each case. Mini Competitions will include work based on a Project Partnering arrangement and/or Traditional tendering basis. The conditions of contract relevant to projects tendered under the terms of the framework shall be either a Standard Form of Partnering Agreement (PPC2000 ACA or similar) or a Standard JCT Form of Building Contract.

The closing date and time for the receipt of final tender applications is 17th January 2017 at 12:00 noon.

This scheme will be piloted for 12 months and aims to provide short term intensive support, to aid recovery and independence, following illness, injury or some other issue that has prevented them returning or remaining home. The goal is to provide people with the best possible opportunity to return home, live independently and avoid unnecessary long-term residential care packages. 
The service will be supported by a multi-disciplinary team, which will support all 14 beds. This team will contain the following skill mix: 
•	GP
•	Team manager
•	Social Worker
•	Occupational Therapist
•	Physiotherapist
•	Rehabilitation assistant
•	Nurse
•	Pharmacist
•	Reablement workers and managers (based at Protheroe House)
•	Nurses and managers (based at Pricilla Wakefield)
For this pilot, the MDT will be provided by Whittington Health, with the exception of the Social Worker (provided by Haringey Council) and the GP (provided through this arrangement).
This services specification is designed to secure GP leadership for the multi-disciplinary team along with GP registration and care coordination for each patient.

The GEIC is a £60 million investment which will establish a state of the art research and technology development facility for graphene and related 2D materials.  Projects in the GEIC will be industry-led and will focus on innovation and applications, with the aim of accelerating research through to products in the marketplace. The GEIC will house pilot production facilities and characterisation equipment. It will initially focus on a number of the University's world-class graphene application areas: energy, composites, formulations and coatings, electronics and membranes.

Given the world leading graphene research at the University, it is expected that all the equipment in the GEIC will be cited in high profile academic publications as well as underpinning industrial collaboration projects, thus giving the equipment a high degree of exposure.
The GEIC will be situated on the North Campus of The University of Manchester, comprise of ~8400 m2 and has been designed by world-renowned architect Rafael Viñoly. It is set to be open in summer 2018. Equipment purchased before the GEIC building is opened will be temporally commissioned elsewhere in the University campus, typically in the National Graphene Institute, and then moved into the GEIC once it is completed.
