The Framework is focused on enabling as many young people to thrive as possible through supporting the whole system with improved understanding and awareness of children's emotional health and wellbeing, their mental health needs and improving the confidence of the whole workforce in identifying needs and helping young people and or managing risk support. 

Commissions under the Thrive framework build a more resilient system and help mitigate the escalation of mental health needs and reduce further growth, by ensuring the right service is available at the right time. This means that community intervention must provide ongoing support, promote early identification of mental health needs, including areas prevention, build resilience, provide early-help for those with low to moderate needs and provide targeted work with vulnerable groups. 

The provider will devise and deliver a mental health drama performance workshop to Year 9 students and their teaching staff and gather evaluation data and insights of young people. The purpose of the project is to raise awareness of the mental health issues affecting young people in Salford, encourage young people to seek assistance and support and provide opportunity to sign post young people to mental health services, support groups and to support networks and to engage young people directly to identify their mental wellbeing concerns and priorities. This includes: creating lesson plans for teaching staff to continue the conversation with students in the weeks and months after the tour; provide information regarding further support to children and young people and to school staff and gathering feedback from participants. 

The service will recognise the social contexts and individual preferences of people and their communities and the service will be co-produced with service users through responding to the identified needs.
