The service has an established identity, Guildford HOST (Homelessness Outreach & Support Team). The Council has agreed funding of £819,600 to enable it to continue the provision of this important service between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2021 and now wishes to procure the services of an organisation to manage and staff this service working alongside the Council and other agencies.
The service will offer: 
•	assertive outreach for vulnerable people rough sleeping, or at risk of rough sleeping 
•	support to people placed in HOST assessment beds 
•	interventions to prevent former rough sleepers who have secured accommodation from being evicted
•	resettlement support to former rough sleepers who have secured accommodation 

The service will follow the principles of good practice as defined by guidance issued by the Department of Communities and Local Governments (CLG) and local policies and protocols agreed by the Council. 

The Council’s current contract with Home Group Ltd will terminate on 30 June 2016 and there are four employees who the Council anticipate will TUPE to the new service provider.  
The Council considers that the minimum level of staffing required to deliver an effective service will be a full time manager (carrying a small caseload) and three frontline outreach workers.  The Council will require the option to participate in staff recruitment.

LOCATION 
It is anticipated that the majority of individuals the service will support, will be located in and around Guildford town centre.  However, the service must also be able to respond to the needs of those sleeping rough across the borough and there may be occasions where resettlement support is required to be delivered to clients assisted to secure accommodation in other areas, including outside Surrey.  
The service provider is required to have a base centrally located within Guildford town centre.",,complete,CPV,85000000,"Health and social work services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"South East","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,700000,GBP,,,,800000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2016-04-26T23:59:59+01:00,,2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00,2021-06-30T23:59:59+01:00,1,1,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-LAE-GRT,"Guildford Borough Council","Guildford Borough Council",GB-LAE,GRT,Millmead,Guildford,"GU2 4BE",England,"Vincent Hunt",vincent.hunt@guildford.gov.uk,"07970 659846",,buyer,GB-CFS-23679,"The Riverside Group","The Riverside Group","2, Estuary Boulevard, Estuary Commerce Park, Liverpool, L24 8RF",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-LAE-GRT,"Guildford Borough Council",ocds-b5fd17-76555f36-adc9-11e6-9901-0019b9f3037b-1,active,2016-06-01T00:00:00+01:00,2016-03-18T19:09:08Z,725673,GBP,GB-CFS-23679,"The Riverside Group",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-07-01T00:00:00+01:00,2021-06-30T23:59:59+01:00,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/20c33204-0902-47e7-8c86-291543647721,2016-03-18T19:09:08Z,text/html,en,,,,2,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet,"Doc 1",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/777769a1-95a6-49cf-aecb-896d83760cf3,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,"doc 3",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/bd6da6ef-1e09-42f3-afe4-901590009eb0,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,4,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,"doc 4",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/cc71fffe-f4f8-48b0-b886-27f7e8f5072a,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,5,application/msword,"Doc 2",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/576c0acf-d0fd-41f9-a512-eac407ecf177,application/msword,6,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,"doc 5",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/3aa1a88a-7f79-471d-a974-8a2d95e6ec4a,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This will allow compliance with national reinstatement specifications, as given in the Specification for the Reinstatement of Openings in Highways (SROH) 1st, 2nd,3rd and future editions or updates to be determined. Providers must provide evidenced interpretive reports documenting certain physical properties of each of the cores taken. All core extraction, sampling and testing shall be carried out by a UKAS accredited laboratory approved to undertake such tests in accordance with the procedures of the relevant British or European standards. Providers must be accredited for the appropriate work categories under the United Kingdom Accreditation Services (UKAS) including for the extraction of core samples from the highway. It is intended to appoint a minimum of 3 providers to the framework agreement subject to there being sufficient tenderers satisfying the criteria laid down within the tender process.

Contracts called-off from the framework agreement will be awarded on a cascade basis, with the tenderer submitting the Most Economically Advantageous Tender being appointed as the first provider to the relevant lot, which will be contacted in the first instance in respect of any service requirements. Should the first provider not have the capacity and/or capability and/or not be willing to provide the services then the second provider and third provider would be contacted in turn. Alternatively, contracting bodies accessing the framework agreement may re-open competition to all providers capable of meeting the requirement within the framework agreement via a ?mini competition? process within the applicable lot(s).

The services provided under the framework agreement will be made available to members and associate members of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) and other participating authorities and organisational bodies as named within this Contract Notice. The Invitation to Tender documentation contains further details on those organisations intending to use this framework agreement at its outset. The estimated number of cores from all classifications of carriageways and footways to be called-off the framework agreement for indicative purposes only is shown within the Invitation to Tender documentation. None of the named organisations will however be obliged to procure through the framework agreement. Economic operators should note that inclusion on the framework agreement is not a guarantee that any call-off contracts will be awarded.

The framework agreement will initially run for a period of 2 years and will allow for 2 further periods of extension of 12 months each. The maximum duration of the framework agreement will be 4 years.

CCTV and associated systems and networks. The contract is to be awarded in 10 Lots as follows:
1. Lot 1 — Network Monitoring and Support;
2. Lot 2 — EBI Application and Systems Support;
3. Lot 3 — BACS Systems Support (Honeywell Buildings);
4. Lot 4 — BACS Systems Support (Schneider Buildings);
5. Lot 5 — Access Control and Security Systems Support (Honeywell);
6. Lot 6 — Access Control Systems Support (G4S);
7. Lot 7 — Access Control Systems Support (Salto);
8. Lot 8 — Security System Support (not FS90);
9. Lot 9 — CCTV Systems Support (terminated without award)
10. Lot 10 — Fire Detection System Support.
This may include the supply and installation of any new requirements, extensions and upgrades of new equipment at the University's discretion.

Additional information: Lot 9 - CCTV systems support was terminated without award. Upon further investigation of the procedure for Lot 9 we do not have confidence that the specification used was robust enough for a free and fair competition. In addition to this, since publication of the tender documents in August 2015, it has been deemed necessary to conduct a root and branch review of our CCTV requirement, which is likely to result in major changes to the contract requirements. Such change would require a new competition under the Public Contract Regulations. We therefore feel obliged to terminate this tender process, for Lot 9, without award.

The Kedleston Road Campus, Derby includes a Clinical Skills Suite http://www.derby.ac.uk/health-and-social-care/choose/clinical-skills-suite/  where health related students can be taught in a realistic hospital setting. Located in the same area is the Health, Lifestyle & Rehabilitation Centre http://www.derby.ac.uk/health-and-social-care/choose/clinical-skills-suite/health-lifestyle-rehabilitation-centre/ where private diagnostic imaging and (soon) counselling services are delivered. The College’s plans include an expansion of the existing services to be delivered to the NHS and an expansion of Health & Social Care related research practice. The Health theme of this part of the Campus continued by the co-location of a GP Practice providing NHS services to University students. 
To support these plans, the University now needs to procure an N3 compliant service for a small stand-alone network within the Kedleston Road Campus from a suitable service provider. The Clinical network will be a separate stand-alone network with all the associated services to meet the NHS Information Governance regime. The University’s internal IT Services department is leading the project to deliver these services and now needs to procure them via this Invitation to Tender

The deliverable will be the design and build of a suitable system with accompanying documentation to support  system  integration into the glider being designed under the BRIDGES project.
This task will integrate a sensor payload targeted to support surveillance of sea-bed mining activities to monitor the impact of discharges of the unwanted debris and to determine nodule characteristics and associated substrate. 
We require an acoustic specialist to design and build a miniaturised acoustic sensor suitable for installation on the D and UD vehicles (to 5000m depth). This low-power, low-range sensor will be used for purely scientific purposes to characterise sea-bed sediment properties. 
The miniaturized acoustic smart sensor will be designed to obtain information on sea bottom sub-surface layers. The sensing package will consist of: a set of transducers and hydrophones for acoustic transmission and reception in the frequency range of 10-30 KHz; a programmable wideband signal generator; a low power and low noise acquisition system and a set of processing algorithms to extract the different acoustic impedances and sound speed profiles of the sea-bottom layers with a penetration up to 10 meters. 
Technical requirements to allow integration with the BRIDGES glider are given below:
Maximum power consumption during sampling: 25W
Total sampling time at bottom of dive no more than: 1 minute @ 25W
Power should be kept to a minimum to maximise deployment time.
Discrete operation enabled/disabled by external input
Communications: Ethernet TCP/IP and/or RS232
Optional PPS TTL signal from glider control for time synchronization
Externally supplied power, max supply voltage: 48V
Data storage on board (approx. 500 Gb)
Comprehensive technical documentation (including manuals, schematics, data sheets, interface protocols and other as required)
Physical size and weight  to be suitable for Glider operations.  It is expected that the glider will have a total maximum wet payload weight of approx. 5Kg .
Maximum Operating depth :  5000m

The new Waterside Campus, opening in September 2018, will provide state-of-the-art academic facilities for 15,000 students, additional residential facilities for 1,200 students and leisure facilities open to the local community.  

The innovative £330m Waterside Campus will transform a 58 acre brownfield site in Northampton’s Waterside Enterprise Zone.  The area is in close proximity to the town centre, a short walk away through the town’s Cultural Quarter and past the University’s St John’s Halls of Residences, opened in 2014.

See http://www.watersidecampus.info/ for further information.

The programme is now at a stage where the Information and Communication Technology elements are to be defined and purchased to ensure the campus is fit for purpose when opened and the University’s vision can be effectively supported by the appropriate technology solutions and services.

The University is seeking a technology partner who can work with us at a strategic level. The strategic partner will work with the University to design, develop and implement solutions and will take responsibility for ensuring continuity and integration, so that the University benefits from an holistic approach to the active infrastructure components that are set out below. The University also expects some sharing of risk with the strategic partner in ensuring that components of the overall IT solution work together in a seamless way.

The supplier must develop a system to be used online and provide a service to cater for schools with limited / no internet access and/or poor IT infrastructure.  

In addition the supplier will need to manage a whole service for the test which includes providing a helpdesk to support schools with technical issues in the system, ensuring that the data captured from the system can feed into other STA data feeds.

The supplier will need to have knowledge of the wide variety of Special Educational Needs in schools and be able to make, and suggest, modifications to the test to cater for these children.

The test will only be focussed on 1-12 times tables; although the length and timing of the test is still to be decided following a wider consultation, it is envisaged that the test will be sat by pupils in May 2017.

This is the first online /onscreen Key Stage 2 test in primary schools and the Standards and Testing Agency are keen to explore all options for the delivery of this contract and will consider using any existing software if it can be fully amended to suit the needs of the test.  It should be noted, however, that any system that is proposed must be able to import and export data with existing STA systems and new systems that may be developed under a new Key Stage 2 test delivery contract in 2018 onwards.

Security requirements are essential and any potential supplier must ensure their services are compliant with the HMG Security Policy Framework in conjunction with current CESG Information Assurance Policy.  As part of this the supplier must be able to demonstrate that:
•	they have achieved, and be able to maintain, independent certification to ISO/IEC 27001.  
•	Will comply with the UK Government Security Classification Policy in respect of Departmental Data being handled in the course of providing this service (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-security-classifications.)  
•	Any electronic transfer methods across public space or cyberspce must be protected via encryption which has been certified to a minimum FIPS 140-2 standard.  This includes and devices / hardware / portable equipment to be used in the delivery of the service

Communities of practice are groups of practitioners who come together to provide peer support, shared expertise and experience in developing a common purpose.  In this instance, the common purpose is designing and implementing multi-specialty community providers in England.
There are 14 MCP vanguards spread geographically across England.
We are looking for a community of practice that brings together all MCP vanguards and also hosts separate events for North and South regions.
The communities started to form in 15/16 and the supplier will need to build on these existing relationships to deliver an effective community of practice.
The supplier will need to demonstrate effective facilitation and coaching at an executive level with an astute understanding of appropriate subject matter experts that may be appropriate to bring in, providing independent support, advice and challenge to developing vanguards.
