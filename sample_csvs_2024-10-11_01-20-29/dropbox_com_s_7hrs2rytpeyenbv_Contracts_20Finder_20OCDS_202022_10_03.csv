The Building is primarily in use by SKDC for the purpose of Theatre but also provides a variety of other services including meeting space, exhibition space café and bar.

The building is thought to have been constructed approximately in the 1760's as the understood construction date of the theatre is 1768. The property is located centrally in Stamford town centre and compromises accommodation over four floors.

The primary works in relation to the building are to resolve any ongoing water ingress issues and allow the building to return to use as intended. To do these repairs, works will be required to the roof structure, to ensure the building is watertight.

The survey has identified numerous issues of repair required to the roof and SKDC will be looking to undertake the following scope of works, as detailed in the specification:

We provide intellectual, scientific and operational leadership at national and local level, as well as on the global stage, to make the nation's health secure.

Malaria is a serious and potentially life-threatening febrile illness caused by infection with the protozoan parasite Plasmodium. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of the female Anopheles mosquito in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. There are 5 species of Plasmodium that infect humans: P. falciparum (responsible for the most severe form of malaria and the most deaths), P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Malaria does not currently occur naturally in the UK, but travel-associated cases are reported in those who have returned to the UK or arrived (either as a visitor or migrant to the UK) from malaria-endemic areas .
The Malaria Reference Laboratory (Malaria RL) provides laboratory reference and diagnostic parasitology of malaria, and surveillance data on all imported malaria reported in the UK. The laboratory processes on average 2,000 samples per year. The results of this work are used to develop national policy on preventing imported malaria. UKHSA is responsible for commissioning this service on behalf of the NHS, devolved administrations of the UK and the Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention .
The Authority's current contract is due to expire on 31st March 2023. The Authority intends to implement a new Contract by 1st April 2023 to ensure the continuation of the service (subject to contract being signed by both parties). 

The aim of this RFI is to understand the markets' ability to meet the Authority's needs for this service and deliverables. This is to ensure that there is a consistent and affordable provision of high quality, safe and compliant Malaria sampling service in the UK.

This usually takes between 8-12 weeks.

Due to the number of temporary properties available we foresee a maximum of two moves out and two moves back in any given week. However, this amount can increase/decrease throughout the contract.  CYC will endeavour to programme moves a month in advance, however, due to the nature of these works they are subject to changes and a final schedule may not be provided until one week before removals are to be undertaken.

We require a supplier to accommodate this flexibility. There may also be occasions, unrelated to this programme of work, when CYC require a tenant's possessions to be moved/stored due to an unforeseen circumstance making their property uninhabitable.

All properties are within the City of York boundary and wherever possible the temporary accommodation is in a similar location to the permanent property.  

In general terms we require the following for each property (which should be accounted for when completing the pricing schedule): 
- Provision of sufficient boxes and packing materials to the tenant 4 weeks prior to removal date.  

Consult the Open ITT Part 2 - Specification document for full details of what is required.

CYC require the successful Supplier to adhere to the British Association of Removers, Code of Practice. Suppliers must evidence they have this imbedded in with their organisation; Please see Appendix D, Code of Practice. Similar associated practices are accepted, please provide information on this.

The initial aim of the service is for an experienced behaviour change and children's weight management team to assess and support children and young people, and their families, with behaviour changes to achieve a healthier weight. The service will ultimately form part of an integrated weight management offer, which will comprise a range of activities and support including, for example, cooking skills, parenting support, peer support etc.

Our intention is to work in partnership with communities, adopting an iterative learning process that enables the gradual transfer of resources allowing them to play an incremental role in the provision of weight management support to their residents. We envisage that significant elements of this service will be developed over time, and we will therefore be writing a developmental service specification.

We expect potential contractors to meet a number of minimum standards; these are detailed in the ITT. We advise all interested contractors to read the entire ITT and all documents referenced or linked to within the ITT carefully, to inform themselves about the opportunity and whether they would be interested in submitting a response.

      The first project is for six units of high-level supported accommodation that will form part of the local rough sleeper pathway. This pathway will contribute to ending rough sleeping in Stafford by 2025 and increase the housing options available to individuals with multiple and complex needs who are rough sleeping, or at risk of rough sleeping. 
      
      The overall aim of the project is to get individuals with a history of rough sleeping or repeat homelessness into sustainable accommodation, with tailored support that addresses underlying needs. The approach will provide strength-based solutions and ongoing support so that no one has to spend a night on our streets 
      and instances of rough sleeping and repeat homelessness will be reduced.
      
      The second project is a coproduction model that will engage the voices of those with lived experience, involving the hardest to reach rough sleepers so their views and experiences become an integral element in developing services for people.

Residents over the age of 65 account for 40% of 'under-occupied' homes, compared to those residents who are under the age of 35, who account for just 4% of under-occupied rented properties.

A property is considered to be 'under-occupied' if it has a single tenant or a couple living in a three-bedroom house.

There are a significant number of households (2501) currently identified as having a housing need on the Isle of Wight (IoW). This has been exacerbated due to factors associated to the Covid 19 pandemic, which has reportedly led to an 82% reduction in Private Rented Sector accommodation being available. 

To manage this increasing need it is vital to ensure housing stock is used effectively and efficiently. The creation of this project follows analysis of under and over occupation of social rented properties on the IOW whereby it has emerged many households are not appropriately matched to the right sized properties in accordance to household need.

The Authority wishes to commission a supplier to undertake this project to ensure maximisation of social housing units is achieved to help the Isle of Wight address the shortage of such units. 

Through this project we plan to identify households looking to RightSize and understand the support needed to achieve this. 

Further guidance on RightSizing is available via the below link:

The term of the contract shall be 31 October 2022 until 31 December 2022 with the option to extend for up to a further three months at the sole discretion of the Authority. 

There is a maximum budget of £25,000 available for this contract. Tenders submitted over this value will be rejected.  

The closing date for receipt of Quotes is 14:00Hrs on 17 October 2022.

The Notting Dale Heat Network is to be delivered and operated by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) wholly owned by the Council, Notting Dale Heat Network Ltd. It is RBKC&apos;s ambition that it  will be the most reliable and proactively maintained heat network in the UK. 
The initial phase of the Project is to serve the Lancaster West Estate (LWE) for which the intended heat users include around 800 residential units, a school, a large Council-owned leisure centre and business units for SMEs (Baseline Studios). This project forms the second part of the Procurement strategy to support the Heat Network delivery.
The Authority is conducting procurement for the design and construction of the Tertiary Networks and all internal (above ground) sections of the Secondary Networks within the Notting Dale Heat Network.
The D&B works for this contract package will comprise:
1. Installation of the above-ground pipework that forms the Secondary Networks serving residential blocks, including the heat interface unit (HIUs) that serve each flat, together with strip out and disposal as appropriate of existing communal heating supply systems.
2. Installation of the Tertiary Networks serving each flat comprising: thermostatic controls, radiators, valves and small diameter distribution pipework; and strip out and disposal of the existing heating systems.
3. On completion of the above works to each block, a permanent connection to the Heat Network is required as soon as the latter has become operational, and undertake test & commissioning.
The D&B Contract period is for 4 years from 9 June  2023 to 9 June  2027.

This service will support children, young people and their families and ensure that the council meets our statutory duties.
      
      This service is exclusively for the Targeted Short Breaks offer and does not include overnight respite or specialist care. It has two elements:
      
      • Specialist Playscheme for children and young people with complex needs 5-19 years.
      
      • Access to a range of regular sessional activities.
      
      The venues will be sourced and funded by the provider. For the Specialist Holiday Playscheme only, a parental contribution will be made for each child of up to £25.00 per day to be collected by provider. The council will agree in writing any annual changes to this figure subject to negotiation.
      
      The council is targeting to have awarded the contract on 20 December 2022 to allow for service commencement on 1 April 2023. The contract will be let for an initial term of 3 years which may then run for a further 2 years in increments set by the Council to a total maximum term of 5 years, subject to performance and at the sole option of the Council.
      
      The estimated total contract value IRO £215,000 pa, £1,075,000 over maximum 5-year contract term. This is based on the current funding for the services.
      
      The contract value is expected to remain in the region of £215,000 per annum for the term of the contract, however it may increase or decrease throughout the contract term subject to any known or unknown changes to budget allocation, variation of services, or addition of further associated services in order to meet changes in demand or the service delivery.
      
      An accurate forecast cannot be made regarding the level of further funding, if any, that may become available, but it is not expected to equate to an increase of more than approx. 10% and therefore approx. £1,182,500 total value over the 5-year maximum term. However, these estimates are not guarantees and are non-binding in terms of any maximum total upper value that may be let via the contracts.
      
      The services covered under the contract are social services and fall under the 'light touch regime'. The Council will execute this procurement process in general accordance with the Open Procedure as set out within the Public Contract Regulations (2015).

The High Intensity User service contributes to the delivery of the NHS Long Term Plan by reducing demand in Urgent and Emergency Care. 

As part of the 2019/20 Operational Planning and Contracting Guidance, all health systems in England were advised to implement a High Intensity User service. 

Using data from a local ambulance service, High Intensity Users of 999 and frequent attenders to A&E were identified through a range of data sources. From previous work undertaken across the country, it was clear that some individuals had little clinical reason for doing so; others had genuine reason for calling or were highlighted as vulnerable.

The service will work with children and young people with special educational needs, emotional, behavioural and social difficulties and children with complex learning difficulties, including autism.

The service supports young people to improve the clinical, educational and social aspects of their lives and to help reduce feelings of isolation. It also works with families / carers and the staff who work with the young people to build capacity and resilience, and to support the delivery of positive outcomes.

The service is currently delivering a range of art and music therapies to pupils across three of Camden's maintained specialist schools as well as targeted work within Camden's mainstream schools where young people are at risk of a placement breaking down. The service is often an alternative to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) for children with SEND and ensures that they have access to the services most suited to them.

and Musical instrument collection. Set within 16 acres of stunning grounds that also house an Aquarium, Animal
Walk and Butterfly House. The Horniman connects us all with global cultures and the natural environment,
encouraging us to shape a positive future for the world we all share
The projects are funded by a capital grant from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Horniman
must spend the money prior to the end of the 22/23 financial year in March 2023.
The Horniman wishes to appoint a suitably qualified consultant for the fire stopping remediation project. This project
is to be broken into two parts. A and B.
Stage 'A' will involve the procurement and appointment of a suitably qualified fire safety specialist consultant (the
consultant must be a chartered fire engineer, accredited with a suitable institution). A series of surveys (some may
be intrusive) across our sites and the development of a fire strategy and report with prioritised recommendations.
The consultant will determine an outline specification and assist the project manager and QS with the creation of a
pricing schedule and site drawings for tender issue, to be issued as an open tender for contractors to price as a cost
plus tender.
Stage 'B' will involve the procurement of a contractor to undertake a 'find and fix' fire stopping and remediation
contract on a cost plus basis according to the compartmentation outlined in the fire strategy put together by the
consultant as per stage A and with the input of the museums specialist consultants as necessary. Listed building
consent, if needed, will be applied for by our consultant architect once the completion of stage 'A' and will run
concurrently with the procurement of stage 'B'.

The overall aim of the scheme is to provide on-road queuing capacity on the M20 coast bound carriageway between J8 and J9 for port-bound freight traffic to minimise disruption on the Kent Strategic and Local Road Networks in the event of Cross-Channel disruption.

Stage 1 delivered a solution to address potential delays caused by additional customs and immigrations checks due to legislative change associated with UK's exit from the EU in January 2021. 

Stage 2 (Phase 1) is a longer-term permanent solution to address delays arising from planned or unplanned emergency events that disrupt port traffic, such as bad weather affecting Channel crossing conditions.

Stage 2 (Phase 2) - this contract - comprises delivery of permanent highway infrastructure to enable a traffic management contra-flow operational solution to be rapidly deployed on the M20 London bound carriageway between J8 and J9 using Moveable Barriers, while port-bound freight is queued on the coast bound carriageway. There are typically 2 emergency events per year each lasting up to 5 days only. Each emergency activation is to be delivered within a 48-hour period to permit resource mobilisation and to include a 12-hour deployment period.",,complete,CPV,45233110,"Motorway construction works",CPV,45233139,"Highway maintenance work",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"South East","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,20210736,GBP,,,,,,,,,,,,,30525344,GBP,selective,"Call-off from a framework agreement",2022-04-25T17:00:00+01:00,,2022-05-03T00:00:00+01:00,2023-04-13T23:59:59+01:00,,,works,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-46746,"Highways England","Highways England",,,"The Cube, 199 Wharfside Street",Birmingham,"B1 1RN",England,"Steven Williams",steven.williams@nationalhighways.co.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-221063,"Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd","Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd",,,"Maxim 7, Maxim Office Park,  Parklands Avenue,  Eurocentral,  Holytown,  Scotland,  ML1 4WQ",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-46746,"Highways England",ocds-b5fd17-a02513b4-3558-45c7-90eb-cdc4e66c0aec-1,active,2022-06-08T00:00:00+01:00,2022-10-03T14:18:09+01:00,30525344,GBP,GB-CFS-221063,"Balfour Beatty Construction Ltd",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2022-05-03T00:00:00+01:00,2023-04-13T23:59:59+01:00,,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/d2403a01-99c1-49a8-9646-8265d7d77916,2022-10-03T14:18:09+01:00,,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To tackle this, in 2020 the NHS agreed the following targets:

• For direct emissions (the NHS Carbon Footprint) to reach net zero by 2040, with an ambition to reach an 80% reduction by 2028 to 2032.
• For the emissions influenced by the NHS e.g. purchased energy (the NHS Carbon Footprint Plus) to be net zero by 2045, with an ambition to reach an 80% reduction by 2036 to 2039.

In a fast-paced and demanding environment with a very high patient flow, it is critical that all staff working in the Emergency Department have access to clear and simple guidance and support to ensure their department is working towards the NHS net zero target. We anticipate that a framework, with clear evidence-based steps on the actions to be taken to make an emergency department a net zero ED, will be needed to meet this objective. It is likely that tailored support and further resources to help emergency departments adopt this framework will also be needed, along with online reporting tools for emergency departments to be able to review and update progress in an easy manner.",,complete,CPV,85100000,"Health services",CPV,79315000,"Social research services",CPV,73200000,"Research and development consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"LS2 7UE",,,England,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,83000,GBP,open,"Open procedure (below threshold)",2022-08-31T12:00:00+01:00,,2022-10-03T00:00:00+01:00,2023-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-166462,"NHS England","NHS England",,,"Quarry Hill",Leeds,"LS2 7UE",England,"NHSE Commercial Team",england.commercialqueries@nhs.net,,,buyer,GB-CFS-172529,"Royal College of Emergency Medicine","Royal College of Emergency Medicine",,,"7-9 Breams Buildings,

This procurement is also open to the GLA group including and not limited to GLA, LLDC, MOPAC and OPDC.

TfL has a mobile estate of c. 60,000 SIM cards covering, primarily:
-corporate and operational staff mobile device users (Corporate Services); and
-'machine-to-machine' (M2M) communications for equipment such as Oyster card readers, ticket machines, ULEZ cameras and the iBus tracking system (M2M Services).

The majority of these services are currently provided by Telefonica O2, albeit some other service providers supply some other smaller volumes of mobile and SIM-related services (collectively ""Mobile Services"").

This procurement is to put in place arrangements for the continued and future delivery of TfL's Mobile Services. The procurement is split into two lots - the Corporate Services Lot and M2M Services Lot.

For the Corporate Services Lot, the intention is to award a contract (""Corporate Services Contract"") with an initial contract term of 3 years with two TfL options to extend for periods of 12 months each, up to 2 further years (i.e. a maximum total term of 5 years).

For the M2M Services Lot, the intention is to award a contract (""M2M Services Contract"") with an initial contract term of 7 years with annual TfL options to extend for periods of 12 months each, up to 7 further years (i.e. a maximum total term of 14 years).
Tenderers may bid for either or both Lots.

TfL reserves the option to consolidate Lot 1 and Lot 2 services into a single Contract if the same Supplier is appointed for both Lots.

Bawtry Town Council looks to appoint a suitable contractor to supply and install electric vehicle charging points at their P&D Car Park  and an appropriate back-office charge point management system.

The installation will help support the Council's overall goal to invest in sustainable alternatives, reduce its own carbon footprint, and will contribute to the reduction of toxic air pollution.

The Council hopes residents and  visitors will be encouraged to make the switch to EV reducing their individual contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.

The Council anticipates a concession agreement being agreed as revenue sharing is desirable.  However the cost of any works has been requested for the provision of the service as  some tenderers may wish to charge a fee for installation, connection etc and a higher revenue share. Others may prefer to  offer free installation and connection and a lower revenue sharing arrangement.

However, the challenges that nursing shortages brings will require a multifaceted and carefully co-ordinated strategy to nurture and grow the nursing workforce. Current and emerging technological innovations provides us with opportunities to deliver contemporary education for a 21st century workforce.
The NHS Long-term plan puts community services at the heart of its ambition to ensure patients receive care closer to home. To ensure that this is achieved a skilled nursing workforce in community, primary and social care services is required. It is recognised that the skills required for nursing in these settings are quite different to those for nursing in secondary care, and there are commonly held myths that newly qualified nurses are firstly required to gain substantial experience of working in acute services before they can apply to work within community & primary care services.  
In addition to the activities set out in the Long-term Plan, there is a real need to consider new approaches to educating and training future nurses in relation to the impact of new and emerging technologies and to ensure that the future workforce is flexible, adaptable, has a growth mindset that is innovative and enthusiastic about change. There is also a need to grow and maintain the workforce to address the needs of the targeted services, service user expectations and diverse settings.

Traditionally, the theoretical elements of nursing degrees have been delivered in a face-to-face manner and complemented with simulation with a 50% practice element through face-to-face placements. While pre-registration nursing programmes rapidly moved to online delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, this does not afford the learner the full benefits of the pedagogic experience that blended learning provides.

Lot 1: traditional bus services with set routes and timetables.
Lot 2 : covers demand responsive transport and other non-typical bus provision.
Note: The DPS excludes the provision of home to school transport for pupils with special transport requirements, e.g. wheelchair and/or passenger assistant.

The Council has a duty under the 1985 Transport Act 'to secure the provision of such public passenger transport services as the council consider it appropriate to secure to meet any public transport requirements ... which would not in its view be met apart from any action taken by it for that purpose.'
The agreement will provide the structure to procure routes, the Bus Strategy developed during 2020 defines what the Council deems appropriate under the Act, and the call offs under this framework will procure those routes, ensuring by the appropriate qualitative criteria that any route details put forward by operators fulfil the requirements defined in the Strategy.
As of June 2022 the Council provides 9 subsidised public bus services operating Mon-Sat with three of these services also operating late into the evening and on Sundays. The Council also contributes to a route procured by the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead. 

The procurement process will be run in accordance with the following programme:
First Mini Tenders released from: 28.11.2022

This project therefore invites a critical literature review of English language research on the topic of quantifying risk to heritage assets. It is essential that the report goes beyond describing research that has been undertaken - Historic England is asking for recommendations as to how best to proceed. A thorough search that concludes that there is no 'off the shelf' solution will be just as valuable as one that finds a suitable method that has been pioneered elsewhere.

Being able to support a group of people who are confident and able to take part in this benefits a range of organisations and enables the voice and perspective of people with lived experience to be maximised.

The London Personalised Care team has recruited and created a Regional Strategic Co-production Group made up of people with lived experience of personalised care who are confident and willing to engage in the programme at a strategic level. The details of these people will be made available to the successful provider (subject to consent from the group members).

The London Personalised Care team has recently set up working groups to support with delivering change across the region for personalised care. These groups are made up of people with lived experience to support the group to coproduce personalised care

The Maternity regional team and Clinical Network draws on the network of Maternity Voices Partnerships and other service users to ensure that the service user voice is central to a number of projects across the region.

Nottingham CityCare is an award-winning community health services provider, dedicated to improving long-term health and wellbeing. We are a social enterprise delivering a range of healthcare services tailored to the needs of local people and free at the point of delivery. We are a provider of NHS services, but we're not the NHS. We have the freedom to be flexible, innovative and responsive and we work with local private, public and voluntary organisations to deliver the services local people need.

It is a key element of our Devolution Deal for York and North Yorkshire   The Scarborough Cyber Security Cluster Strategy aspires to establish Scarborough and the Yorkshire Coast as national centre of excellence for cyber security with a specialist focus on OT - backed by a strategic partnership between government, industry and academic institutions - creating new opportunities, product, services and solutions to new and existing business and providing new, innovative and in demand cyber security skills.

      The main purpose of the site is to house the buildings which provide the close controlled environmental conditions to house major elements of the BFI National Collection of Film and Television, which is the World's largest collection of moving image film and television.
      
      The power consumption at the Gaydon site is approximately 1,500,000 kWh per annum and, in keeping with carbon reduction and cost reduction targets, the BFI investigated the installation of solar photovoltaic cells at Gaydon in order to reduce the BFI's carbon footprint and reliance on the National Grid.
      
      We have identified, and obtained planning permission, for the installation of ground mounted PV panels to two areas which are either side of the Master Film Store building. Further details of the requirements can be found within the Invitation to Tender.

      Over time as the group has grown we've developed the need for multiple brand & company identities and as such multiple websites. During this process we've historically gone out to market for a new website and had an open approach to working with different agencies for each website and brand/company.
      Whilst this approach has worked for us so far it has also created complexities for ongoing maintenance:
      
      Standardised changes such as security & accessibility need to be carried out across all sites individually, which increases costs and also means explaining the same issues to multiple suppliers.
      Three separate contracts and suppliers to manage and maintain relationships with.
      Multiple content management systems to learn and manage.
      
      Core requirements
      
      Single platform & hosting - As the project name suggest our first and foremost requirement is to consolidate all of our existing websites in to one platform, hosted by one supplier. Please see the specification of requirements in the document pack for more information.
      
      Engagement sessions must be booked with the Ongo project team as per the section 4 of the instructions to tenderers.

As part of global efforts to improve forest management and tackle deforestation, FGMC supports international policy processes which tackle illegal logging in timber-producing developing countries and the trade in illegally produced timber products. 

The programme focuses on policy and legal reforms that eliminate illegal logging and illegal deforestation, establish transparency, promote legal trade and ensure rights and benefits for people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, local communities and indigenous people. The FGMC approach enables local interests (government, private sector and civil society) to come together to address and settle long standing grievances and injustices through a formal, inclusive, facilitated and reasoned process of deliberation, that bestows legitimacy on legal reforms. Legal and policy reforms that have been reached and legitimised through a process of deliberation are more likely to be regarded as fair and, therefore, enforced. The focus of the final phase of the programme is about securing and institutionalising these gains. 

3.	CONSULTANCY PURPOSE 
The purpose of this consultancy is to conduct an evaluation of the projects' relevance, design, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and value for money.  It should also review gender issues and governance arrangements and all these aspects will inform new project design. Specifically, this consultancy seeks to:
a)	Understand whether the project has achieved its intended outcome and outputs, as outlined in the project's logframe and theory of change
b)	Review the project's management and governance arrangements, including the link between country partners, network offices, WWF China and WWF-UK
c)	Provide WWF-UK with recommendations on what should be retained in future FGMC projects and if any, how arrangements to managing the grants should be changed in future.
The evaluation will be used to validate results for inclusion in the project completion reports (due late January 2023 - tbc) and recommendations will also be used to inform the design of the next phase of work as well as any applications to the next round of FGMC funding (expected mid 2023).

•	an annuity comparison tool; 
•	an investment pathways comparison tool; 
•	a suite of financial planning calculations to power our pension guidance
•	potential 4th lot for interface
MaPS anticipate this being a single tender with the above requirements in three or four separate Lots.

As part of its pensions guidance transformation strategy, the Money and Pension Service (MaPS) is looking to improve its digital pensions guidance offering by providing retirement planning journeys and tools that meet the needs of different groups of people. 

The annuity and investment pathways comparison tools along with the suite of financial planning calculations will help consumers to model their options at retirement and answer what do I need and what should I do now. 

They are therefore a key enabler in the development and provision of MaPS pension guidance. 

Going forwards our intention is for all tools to be developed and built on our consumer facing website, MoneyHelper. Our digital tools strategy is to develop and maintain the front-end user interfaces and functionality but are looking for suppliers to provide the necessary back-end calculation capability via API's to support the provision of those tools and journeys. 

We are engaging the market prior to the tender process, to further outline the tools strategy, the outcomes MaPS are looking to achieve and to obtain any feedback on the Specifications.

Virtual Event:
A virtual Early Market Engagement event will be held for this project on 25th October at 12pm, via Microsoft Teams. The purpose of this event is to alert the market to the potential procurement opportunity and to gain a better understanding of the capacity and appetite of the market to deliver against the proposed planned activities.

Several additional local organisations will also support delivery to expand the geographic area to cover the whole of the Heart of the South West LEP area and increase the outputs in terms of farms supported.  These, additional service providers will be procured under the Public Contracts regulations 2015 as a separate piece of work.
The intention is to procure Business Information Point (BIP) and Cosmic Consortium via direct award from the Business Support Framework to provide resilience support to farmers and land managers to help them prepare for, and adjust to, the Agricultural Transition by addressing the opportunities it presents and the impacts it could have. The project will also monitor the impact and value for money of this resilience support. BIP have previously been contracted to deliver the pilot and interim phase of this programme. This funding is for the final (scale up) phase of the Future Farming Resilience programme.

For this call-off, BIP will be the lead provider within this Consortium and will be the organisation providing the support to the other providers that we are procuring separately.

Cosmic will be sub-contracted to carry out some of the digital workshops and 121 support on behalf of BIP.  Cosmic offer specific expertise in the digital aspect of farm resilience and upskilling.
