DO NOT apply directly to the buyer OJEU http://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:299414-2017:TEXT:EN:HTML&src=0 
This invitation to tender is to conduct phase 1 of an evaluation covering Innovate UK's Fund activity. There will be two cohorts of projects covered by the evaluation. This first cohort will cover projects awarded funding from April 2016 - March 2017, the first year of the new competition structure. The second cohort will cover projects awarded funding from April 2017 - March 2018. Given the expected lag from award to impact, this two-phase evaluation is expected to run up until 2023 for the first cohort and 2024 for the second cohort of projects. However, the first phase of this project which forms the focus of this RfP will be over a four year period until July 2022 with a second phase, which will be commissioned separately, completing the evaluation by 2024. Given the phased nature of this evaluation, any data used, including contact details, must be provided in a state in which it can be shared either with Innovate UK or a third party contractor at the end of the phase 1 evaluation. Proposals must set out how this will be achieved.
This project will include a process evaluation alongside a full economic evaluation. The process evaluation will assess the effectiveness of Innovate UK's processes around Fund, while the economic evaluation will robustly measure the outputs, outcomes and impacts of Innovate UK's Fund activities, covering all projects awarded across the sector groups and open competitions. 
A final report for this first phase of the evaluation will be delivered in 2022, with annual interim reports providing updates between the contract start date and the final report. Interim reports should present findings as they emerge, starting with processes, inputs, and activities, moving on to outputs, outcomes and impacts. In some years the interim report will be an update on evaluation progress, where new findings have not emerged within that year.

.
A recent tender for training in this subject was awarded and is starting across RCUK

To build on this training, RCUK wishes to create an On-Line Training Module for Peer Reviewers so that individuals can undertake training  at a time & place of their choosing
.
This would initially be used by peer reviewers approached by the Research Councils but it is expected that the Training Module will be used / endorsed by others within the broader ‘research community’ and become the standard resource for such individuals 
.
The appointed provider to develop the On-Line Training Module for Peer Reviewers will be expected to have an innovative, robust and cutting edge approach to content delivery coupled with a pragmatic attitude to maintain ease of access & use for the individuals using the system
.
The appointed provider will need to liaise closely with representatives of both RCUK & the existing supplier as content for the on-line training module will be provided by that organisation to dovetail with the current face-to-face training
.  
The appointed provider will be expected to have the capability and experience to capture ‘real life’ RCUK experiences and work with RCUK & the existing supplier to create a series of short on-line learning modules which can be accessed by peer reviewers

Brief Description of Requirement

The Low Pay Commission (LPC) invites tenders for research that facilitates a better understanding of how employers set pay for young people.

We are also interested in whether the policy framework for employers regarding young people, for example the different treatment with regards to National Insurance and funding for training, has affected pay decisions. We are also interested in how these may have changed over time.

Brief Description of Requirement

The Low Pay Commission (LPC) invites tenders for an examination of the impact of the minimum wage on earnings and wage differentials.
The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the minimum wage on hourly and weekly earnings, and assess whether, and to what extent, wage differentials have been squeezed. The LPC is also keen to gauge the extent to which the NLW has become established as the 'going rate'. In addition, this project would ideally provide an analysis of whether wages and differentials reflect skills and productivity differences by sector.

Additional information: We have introduced a new electronic tendering system called CSW-JETS (Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire's Joint E-Tendering System). In order for you to do business with us in the future you must register on the system by following the link below and then clicking the 'register here' button. 

www.csw-jets.co.uk

CSW-JETS is the new sub-regional e-tendering portal run by In-tend.  Since February 2010, Coventry, Solihull, Warwickshire, Nuneaton & Bedworth and Rugby Councils have been working together as a shared procurement service. Along with Solihull Community Housing, we have joined together to bring you a collaborative E-Tendering portal. 

CSW-JETS enables us to advertise our opportunities across all authorities through the same system. This means that there is a single point of contact for procurement in the sub-region so you only have to register once to receive notifications for all authorities. Registering on the portal will make it easier for local suppliers to find, respond to and be alerted to tender opportunities. 

Registration is free, and takes just a few minutes. When complete, you will be able to express interest in any of the Councils'/Authorities' opportunities when they are made available. In addition, we will be able to access your details whenever we have a requirement, and you may then be invited to tender or quote for work.

The winning bidder will be expected to produce a report which HEFCE intends to publish and which will provide insight to HE providers as well as governmental and non-governmental agencies on current and future recruitment of mature students to healthcare courses. In order to do so, it will :
•	analyse determinants of success in recruiting mature students 
•	analyse challenges in reaching and attracting mature students
•	make recommendations for providers and professional bodies on ways to maintain or increase overall numbers of mature entrants to healthcare courses
•	make recommendations for providers and professional bodies on ways to sustain the diversity of mature entrants to healthcare courses.

We hope that the lessons to be learned from these case studies will be valuable to providers and professional bodies regarding mature student engagement in Higher Education overall, so it would be desirable for any such wider lessons to be set out in the report.

Brief Description of Requirement
The principal objective of this work is to develop a framework for the full evaluation of the UKRPIF programme. The winning bidder will be expected to develop a framework that can be applied by the UKRPIF principal awardees to the breadth of the projects across the UKRPIF programme at an individual level and which then makes it possible to facilitate a full programme evaluation. The framework should answer questions such as (this is not an exhaustive list):
• What qualitative, as well as quantitative, KPIs and range of methodologies would be most appropriate for projects to follow and later on for the scheme to collate, including the limitations of these (with particular reference to the breadth of fields that UKRPIF covers, recognising that one KPI does not fit all)?
• Can counterfactuals, informed by a range of stakeholders, be identified to assess whether the benefits realised might have occurred without UKRPIF funds?
• What is a suitable timeframe for evaluation activity, both at individual project and programme wide level (timings may differ between projects)?

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the RFx attachments tab within the Emptoris System. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria set out in the ITQ document.

Brief Description of Requirement
The Aurora Programme, was set up in 2005 by the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC).  At the end of 2016 this became the Robotic Exploration Programme but is still commonly known as the Aurora programme by many people.  The first mission of this programme was ExoMars, with the overall goal of the robotic and human exploration of Mars. The overall ExoMars mission is divided into 2 related components the Trace Gas Orbiter launched in 2016 and the rover to be launched in 2020.  The purpose of ExoMars is to search for signs of past and present life on Mars, and more specifically, investigate how the water and geochemical environment varies and explore martian atmospheric trace gases and their sources.  The mid-term objective but not necessarily the next mission was to participate in an international mission to collect samples from Mars and bring them back to Earth for analysis. The eventual aim of Exomars is a manned mission to Mars in approximately 50-100yrs.  

The central aim of this tender is the evaluation of the aurora programme and the UK inputs and activities, outcomes and impacts associated with it to date. This will help the UKSA to understand if the programme is on track to deliver its objectives and how it might be improved in future. The evaluation should provide evidence that allows the Agency to assess what impact of the aurora programme has had, relative to what would have happened in its absence.

National Oceanography Centre (NOC) has a requirement to replace internal expansion mastic joints at node 9 of the Southampton site.  The need to undertake this project was recommended during a site condition survey undertaken by NOC in 2016. 
Tenders are invited from suitably qualified and experienced Principal contractors to undertake and complete the works detailed as part of this Scope of Works. 
The project involves the replacement of internal mastic joints within Area 494, plus the replacement of the primary (internal) movement joints through the full intersection of Nodes 4 and 9 of the structural frame. 
Area 494 comprises a single central corridor, with a series of self-contained rooms to each side - as indicated on the following reference plan.  The rooms are generally fitted out as offices, but some (Rooms 494/01, 494/02, 494/12 and 494/18) are fitted out as laboratories.
The scope of this survey is to check the condition of the internal mastic joints in Area 494 of the NOC main building, and to give recommendations for repair or replacement as appropriate.  The survey was carried out by representatives of William Attwell & Associates on 21 September 2017. 
Samples of the mastic joint materials were taken from Rooms (494) 03, 06, 07, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20 and corridor 494/100.  The remaining rooms and laboratories were subject to a visual inspection only. 

A full specification can be seen attached to this tender.

The 18th May ACAS agreement for the Junior Doctors Contract committed HEE to lead a process for developing evidence-based, innovative approaches to training for junior doctors,
... to remove as far as possible the disadvantage of those who take time out due to, for example, caring responsibilities. This approach would include targeted accelerated learning with the prime intention to enable the person who has taken time out to catch up.
HEE published its Supported Return to Training investment and strategy plan in November 2017. 
HEE proposed that there should be a ""menu"" of options for trainees that can be built into a bespoke package that accommodates the individual trainee, their specialty, their circumstances and their reasons for leaving in the first place. As part of its investment plan a National innovation fund has been allocated within 2017/18 for specialty-specific knowledge based learning resources to help support trainees with skills and knowledge fade after they return to training after time out of programme.

Partners across the North of England - led by the Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) and the N8 universities of the North, and in partnership with Innovate UK and the BEIS Smart Specialisation Hub - are keen to more effectively support innovation, and the commercialisation of the region's excellence in business and nationally/ internationally competitive specialisms in science and research. This will complement work in local innovation eco-systems, and by Innovate UK nationally. 
The primary objective is to draw together a strategic evidence base about Northern innovation strengths and assets, opportunities and eco-systems drawing from a range of published reports and through engagement with key innovation partners. 
A secondary objective is to identify a deliverable set of innovation-related activities that are best undertaken at pan-Northern level, where collaborative action can improve the productivity and competitiveness of places in the north and the north as a whole. 

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the RFx attachments tab within the Emptoris System.

Brief Description of Requirement
he Research Excellence Framework (REF) is the system for assessing research in UK higher education institutions (HEIs). It was first conducted in 2014, and replaced the previous Research Assessment Exercise. The REF will be undertaken by the four UK higher education funding bodies: the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the Scottish Funding Council (SFC), the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), and the Department for the Economy, Northern Ireland (DfE). The exercise will be managed by the REF team based at HEFCE and overseen by the REF Steering Group, consisting of representatives of the four UK higher education funding bodies.
The funding bodies' shared policy aim for research assessment is to secure the continuation of a world-class, dynamic and responsive research base across the full academic spectrum within UK higher education.
The overarching aim of the project is to develop recommendations for the standardised use of quantitative evidence of impact, drawing on the quantitative indicators used as evidence of impact in REF 2014 submissions. These recommendations will be presented to the REF's expert panels in order to inform their development of guidelines and criteria.
Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the RFx attachments tab within the Emptoris System. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria set out in the ITQ document.

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria set out in the ITQ document. 

UK Water Partnership's Water and Cities Task Force identified that an integrated, holistic picture of urban water could provide the optimal balance to deliver benefits to communities and local economies and that this could be achieved through the development of urban water simulators. To take this initiative forwards, the Science & Technology Facilities Council (STFC) sponsored an Urban Water Simulators workshop in March 2016 with experts from industry, government and academia. A further meeting was held in January 2017 to discuss potential opportunities and the interests of participants in taking forwards the key recommendations and actions from the workshop in March 2016. This meeting agreed that the definition and vision would be broadened from 'urban' to include catchments and that the term 'Water Simulators' would be used to encapsulate this. The meeting further identified that the timing and opportunity to take forward this area is ripe as the UK has capabilities in place and could build on these and that a scoping study was now required to understand needs and interests.

The NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) is responsible for the NHS Jobs Service across England and Wales. The current contract for provision of the service ends in 2020 and the NHSBSA has begun work on the replacement service and website. The overall vision and aim of the service is to get the right people into the right NHS roles in the best and most efficient way possible.

The project is using agile methodology and is currently in the Discovery phase, which has included creating a target operating model (TOM) for the service. 

The purpose of this event is to brief interested parties on the details of the TOM and to refine this model by receiving valuable feedback from thought-leaders brought from all sectors. Any parties who have the interests of NHS Jobs at heart and are motivated by improving the NHS are most welcome. 

Due to capacity the number of attendees is limited to 2 per organisation.

This event is being facilitated by techUK and is open to techUK members and non-members alike. Interested parties who are not members of techUK and wish to attend should contact:

The aim of the Review is to ensure that the Council can deliver its vision ('To be a Council which is ambitious for West Lancashire - our Economy, Environment and for Health and Wellbeing'), key priorities, and maintain service provision and financial sustainability beyond 2020/21.
It is anticipated that the Council will appoint experienced and suitably qualified consultants to undertake key aspects of the Review, for which a tendering exercise or exercises will be necessary.
Prior to embarking on a tendering exercise, the Council is launching a Soft Market Testing exercise, with the following objectives: 
(1) to facilitate early engagement with the market to ensure that the widest possible range of interested organisations are fully aware of the project, its scope and timescales;
(2) to allow interested organisations with appropriate experience to outline their views and provide information with no commitment to themselves or to the Council; 
(3) to allow the Council to confirm, or encourage critical assessment of, the viability of its plans;
(4) to gain expert input to inform the specifications for the tender exercise, and the structure and phasing of the tender requirements, in order to make the most of the opportunities, expertise and options available.
We emphasise that this is a soft market testing exercise, NOT a call for competition. 
A questionnaire, together with further details of the project and programme, and the Council's key priorities, can be downloaded from The Chest portal at www.the-chest.org.uk 
The Chest is an electronic tendering portal for public sector organisations in the north west of England. Registration and use of The Chest by potential suppliers is free of charge.

The intention is to retrofit 15 of Exeter City Council (6 homes in Exeter)
3 / 5
North Devon Homes (2 homes in North Devon) and Sanctuary Housing (7 homes in Torbay), requiring a singlecontractor to design, build and guarantee energy and maintenance performance.
This is part of the Zero Energy Buildings Catalyst project, led by Devon County Council, with the three sociallandlords, Regen and EnergiesprongUK as partners and part funded by the European Regional DevelopmentFund.
Energiesprong is the successful Dutch approach to self-financing net zero energy retrofit of homes. Keycomponents of the approach include:
• average annual energy generation is equivalent to consumption per property, or as close as achievable;
• construction time on site is limited, requiring offsite solutions;
• the contractor is required to provide long term guarantee of energy, comfort and maintenance performance;
• residents pay a fixed regular service charge in return for guaranteed comfort - temperature, hot water, powerand air quality;
• capital cost is financed by the landlord against guaranteed maintenance savings and service charge income;
• As the market grows to scale, increasing volume and industrialisation of offsite construction enable self-financing retrofit.
Thousands of home retrofits are now being delivered in the Netherlands, without public subsidy. It is the aim ofthe project partners to prove the concept with this demonstration and, if successful, to bring more properties tomarket subject to availability of funding.
The total fixed budget for the contract is £1,223,893, including VAT where applicable.

The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) wishes to issue a contract for analytical expertise to support consortia in the development of these SIAs.

BIS has regularly assessed the overall impact of its science and research investments and the performance of the UK research base, publishing reports on the international competitiveness of the UK research base. The latest of these was published in 2013 . 

The Government will soon invite consortia to undertake analysis at a local level in the form of Science and Innovation Audits (SIAs) . Through these SIAs, consortia will map local research and innovation strengths and infrastructure, providing new innovative ways to identify and build on areas of greatest potential across the UK. Elsevier (2015) carried out a study looking at the comparative advantage of Amsterdam compared to other key European cities in terms of research and innovation , which bidders may find useful to consider when developing their approach to SIAs.

This specification is for rigorous analytical support to the consortia as they develop their SIAs.  Drawing on the expertise and analytical support of the contractor, the consortia will use local level data or local subsets of national data to identify strengths and potential areas of strategic focus for their areas. As well as mapping future growth potential, the SIAs will examine the current mechanisms through which investment in science and innovation in their area leads to local productivity, international trade and investment, and growth, and any barriers to this growth being realised. This will be done by linking the following:

•	Excellence in science and research highlighting areas of world leading strengths
•	Strengths in innovation activity
•	Science and innovation assets including institutes and facilities
•	Local industrial strengths and capacity especially in nascent industries and emerging disruptive technologies
•	Local strengths in international trade and attracting international investment
•	The ability to work collaboratively across the science and innovation landscape
•	Level of engagement with and by the business community
•	Coherence with other existing or planned local or national activity to support research and innovation including the development of local infrastructure
•	The comparative strengths on which to build future innovation, growth and prosperity

WMCA will evaluate tenders received on the basis of the evaluation criteria specified in the procurement documentation and will award a Concession Agreement to the bidder which submits the most economically advantageous tender. Estimated value: £15,000,000 and £30,000,000. (WMCA will be providing support for the scheme to help ensure its success, but will contribute neither to up-front (capital) or ongoing (revenue) costs). 

-WMCA is seeking a single supplier to provide a high quality Bikeshare scheme, with physical docking infrastructure with hybrid solutions, across the urban areas within each of the seven constituent authorities (Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell, Solihull, Walsall and Wolverhampton) from spring 2018 and the key features of the scheme are as follows:
i. A phased roll-out of the scheme is intended, potentially starting in central Birmingham, growing to become present in all constituent local authority areas within the first year.
ii. A Concession Agreement between WMCA and its official Bikeshare supplier will have an initial term of five years from the date of roll-out of the Bikeshare cycles, with a possible 3-year extension exercisable at the WMCA's discretion.
iii. The scheme will provide a minimum of 3,000 bikes.
iv. Bikes will be physically 'docked' in certain locations in city centres; and outside the city centre areas, it may be possible to provide geo-fenced docking stations subject to the agreement of the local highway authority but WMCA's preference is for physical docking infrastructure due to WMCA's planning and streetscape requirements.
v. The scheme will integrate fully with the existing public transport network to offer a seamless, high quality transport service for people in the West Midlands.
The Bikeshare scheme will be fully supported by WMCA, but it is to be fully owned and operated by the supplier. Bidders will be evaluated wholly on quality, as set out in the procurement documents. WMCA will be providing support for the scheme to help ensure its success, but will contribute neither to up-front (capital) or ongoing (revenue) costs. 
Due to the requirement that the scheme of operated across seven constituent authority areas, WMCA is not dividing the contract into lots, as the integration and cohesion of the scheme across these areas is fundamental to the success of the scheme. 
Further information and a detailed specification are contained in the tender documentation.

-Contract start and end date are indicative and will be confirmed upon award.

Additional information: -Notes on preliminary market consultation:

• A process comparable with Regulation 40 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 was operated in relation to this procurement pursuant to which a questionnaire was issued to a number of potential suppliers (Bewegen, Donkey Republic, Echo bikes, Full Speed Bikes, Gonbikes, Hourbike, Mobike, Nextbike, Ofo, Serco, Smoove, Yellow bikes, Yobikes) with a view to obtaining advice from the market and preparing the procurement and informing the market of WMCA's procurement plans and requirements for the bike share scheme. 

• Following the questionnaire, an open day was held at WMCA's offices on 18th July 2017. The supplier open day was formatted to inform all attendants of the provisional plans for the West Midlands and the feasibility study which is currently being undertaken. It was made clear to all invitees that the supplier day was not a requirement for further procurement going forward.",2017-11-29T09:50:42Z,complete,CPV,34430000,Bicycles,CPV,39151100,Racking,CPV,72222300,"Information technology services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"West Midlands","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,30000000,GBP,open,"Open procedure (above threshold)",2018-01-23T23:59:59Z,2018-03-31T00:00:00+01:00,2023-03-30T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sWfz42zD,"West Midlands Combined Authority","West Midlands Combined Authority",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sWfz42zD,"16 Summer Lane",Birmingham,"B19 3SD",England,"WMCA Procurement Team",procurement.team@wmca.org.uk,,http://www.wmca.org.uk,buyer,GB-CFS-81827,"Nextbike UK Ltd","Nextbike UK Ltd",,,"359 Kennington Lane

Farmbench is AHDB's new, cross sector benchmarking programme, open for use by farmers and their advisers across the UK.  The programme allows farmers to enter data and anonymously compare their business performance to regional and national average datasets.  The programme currently covers combinable crop, potato and beef and lamb enterprises.  It will be extended to cover dairy and sugar beet enterprises during the second half of 2018.

Data can be entered by farmers, their advisers (e.g. consultants, agronomists and vets) and AHDB staff.  Once complete, the supplier will validate datasets for completeness and accuracy.  This is important to ensure that datasets are free from errors and omissions.  This is important for two main reasons:

1)	It provides confidence to farmers that their individual reports are accurate, which is important when business changing decisions could be taken based on Farmbench data.
2)	It provides confidence to industry that datasets admitted to form the benchmark averages are robust and reliable.

The supplier will be validating physical and financial data across the sectors listed above, and a degree of familiarity with agricultural production systems and physical and financial data will be required.

The validation work has a seasonal nature with the busiest period running from November to June.

Additional information: If you are interested in this opportunity, please email Derek Carless at derek.carless@ahdb.org.uk

Tailored search profiles have been developed for each client, so that each receives just those contract opportunities that are appropriate to their business.  Searches are carried out daily (or sometimes weekly, if clients prefer) and any relevant contracts are notified to clients by e-mail.  Going forward, companies will access this service free of charge. 

In order to improve further the efficiency and consistent delivery of this service across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, it is proposed to outsource that part of the service which relates to the regular searches of the contract opportunities and delivery of the results to clients.

Initial profile development will be carried out by the local Network partner with the SME client. From this point, the contractor would take over the setting up of search profiles and the delivery of the daily / weekly service to the client. The contractor will be required to provide regular reports to the originating Network partners and to work with them to ensure the quality of the service delivered and the measurement of customer satisfaction and impact.

Additional information: The contract Term will be for one year with the option to extend for one further year.  There is no guarantee that this contract will be extended.

This insight will allow us to better plan and deliver on our right message, right person strategy and therefore improve the way in which we serve our organisational strategic aims with some obvious key benefits:
 
•	More time for the team to add value to their roles, rather than wasting time repeating processes or simply waiting for the tools to operate properly
•	Improved understanding of how customers discover us and are nurtured through the customer journey across all digital channels
•	The ability to plan, produce, control and publish content on web, social, and email channels ensuring consistent messaging
•	Faster conversion to sign up - to hear from Innovate UK in general, for events & webinars, for competition application 
•	The ability to define channel ROI and allow us to attribute budget accordingly


About UK Shared Business Services 
Putting the business into shared services
UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise.
It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector.

Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. 

Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams.
UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It's what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre. What is more, being a not-for-profit organisation owned by its customers, UK SBS' goals are aligned with the public sector and delivering best value for the UK taxpayer.
UK Shared Business Services Ltd changed its name from RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd in March 2013.
Our Customers
Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Service (CSS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.
UK SBS currently manages £700m expenditure for its Customers, our growth projections anticipate this will rise to £1bn in 2013/14.

•	Update with 2016 Company data
This part of the project will involve collecting data on UK health life science companies, validating the data for accuracy, and analysing and segmenting the data according to agreed processes and categories, and updating the master spreadsheet / database.  
It is expected this will follow CBSL’s (the current provider) previously agreed and used processes including matching with Dun & Bradstreet & FAME data to provide turnover and employment. In 2015 we started using a new matching process identified by CBSL to deliver more accurate data and CBSL will provide a narrative to describe the new process for future use. 
Dun & Bradstreet and FAME contracts are the responsibility of OLS.
•	Digital Health & Genomics data
To deliver OLS policy priorities on digital health and genomics we require updated data on UK companies working in these sectors and technologies. The contract will include a specific piece of work on digital health companies to review, analyse and validate a list of companies (approx. 200) that OLS has collected that are not currently in the Health Life Sciences database; and to review companies already in the database that may also engage in digital health activities that are not captured in our data. 
•	Annual Strength & Opportunity Report
As in past years, OLS will publish an annual report on the size and shape of the UK life sciences sector. This part of the project will require production of the annual Strength and Opportunity report including preparing infographics, narrative, tables and charts on the state of the UK life sciences sector, and a publicly disclosable cut of the underlying data in an Excel spreadsheet, in discussion with OLS, for publication on the BIS website www.gov.uk/government/publications/bioscience-and-health-technology-database-annual-report-2015.
•	UK Life Sciences website
The UK Life Sciences website www.lifesciences.ukti.gov.uk/ is the public facing portal allowing users to search for companies by sector, segment and region. The website will need to continue to be hosted to existing security levels and remain available to the public on an appropriate web server. 
The website will need to be updated with the 2016 data including appropriate adjustments for data held under licence that cannot be disclosed, for example, turnover & employment, which must be banded for the website.
Throughout the duration of the contract the website will need to be updated to add or amend individual companies and associated information, in line with existing protocols and in agreement with OLS.
•	Tableau workbook
OLS uses Tableau to deliver a user-friendly tool to interrogate the company data and generate standard reports and visualisations. This will need to be updated with the 2016 data which maintains all the existing agreed visualisations. OLS may require new visualisations in discussion with the provider. Hosting Tableau is the responsibility of OLS.",2016-08-22T15:28:09+01:00,complete,CPV,30000000,"Office and computing machinery, equipment and supplies except furniture and software packages",CPV,48000000,"Software package and information systems",CPV,72000000,"IT services: consulting, software development, Internet and support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,London,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,open,"Open procedure (below threshold)",2016-09-14T23:59:59+01:00,2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00,2017-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED","UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"North Star House, North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,,ictprocurement@uksbs.co.uk,,,buyer,GB-COH-05741804,"CELS BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED","CELS BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",GB-COH,05741804,"BIOMEDICINE WEST WING

This includes both short term and long term sickness, with short term at 3.5% days absent per employee. An Occupational Health service is vital in assisting Housing and Care 21 in managing the sickness absence (both short term and long term) within the organisation and to provide assistance with pre-employment health checks prior to candidates commencing employment.

The service provided will be for employees, managers and the Employee Relations and HR Team who assist managers in dealing with sickness absence. We have 600 managers working nationally across the organisation who will need to be able to access the OH Service in order to manage the sickness absence of their teams. The service therefore needs to be accessible, easy to use and efficient. 

The objective of this tender is to appoint a suitable, experienced supplier to provide a cost effective, high quality and reliable service for Occupational Health.

Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Services (CCS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.
UK SBS currently manages £700m expenditure for its Customers.

From the 2nd April 2014 the Government is introducing its new Government Security Classifications (GSC) classification scheme to replace the current Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). A key aspect of this is the reduction in the number of security classifications used. All potential suppliers should make themselves aware of the changes as it may impact on this Requirement. The link below to the Gov.uk website provides information on the new GSC:

About UK Shared Business Services 
Putting the business into shared services
UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise.
It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector.

Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. 

Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams.
UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It’s what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre. What is more, being a not-for-profit organisation owned by its customers, UK SBS’ goals are aligned with the public sector and delivering best value for the UK taxpayer.
UK Shared Business Services Ltd changed its name from RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd in March 2013.
Our Customers
Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Service (CSS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.
UK SBS currently manages £700m expenditure for its Customers, our growth projections anticipate this will rise to £1bn in 2013/14. 
Important information

From the 2nd April 2014 the Government is introducing its new Government Security Classifications (GSC) classification scheme to replace the current Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). A key aspect of this is the reduction in the number of security classifications used. All potential suppliers should make themselves aware of the changes as it may impact on this Requirement. The link below to the Gov.uk website provides information on the new GSC:

The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) is one of seven UK Research Councils funded by UK Government. We collaborate extensively with industry and our long-term R&D underpins sectors which contribute billions of pounds annually to the UK economy in sectors including: space, pharmaceuticals, digital animation and communication, microelectronics and physics based manufacturing.

STFC manages a number of Business Incubation Centres (BICs) to support entrepreneurial businesses to negotiate the challenges that can be faced in market entry. Our unique spectrum of incubation facilities, including the Innovation Technology Access Centre (I-TAC) facility, the ESA and STFC CERN BICs, are set within our dynamic multi-sector campus environment. A presence on Campus gives firms greater opportunity to interact with companies working on related technology, and raises their profile with prospective investors. 

We wish to develop our business support offering at STFC’s Sci-Tech Daresbury campus, near Warrington in Cheshire, where businesses co-locate with STFC in the right environment for start-up companies to develop new products and gain investment, leading to growth and the creation of new jobs.

The business incubation offering is also expanding with the recent opening of the Campus Technology Hub in late 2015 and more recently the new UK Space Agency Incubator.
