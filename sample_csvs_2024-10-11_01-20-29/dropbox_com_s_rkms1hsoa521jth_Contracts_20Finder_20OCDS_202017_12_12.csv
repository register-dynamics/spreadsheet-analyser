It contains areas of dry and wet heath, mire, fen and open water, and a diverse mix of wildlife habitats. The reserve's range of habitats and species has resulted in its being designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest, National Nature Reserve and a Special Area of Conservation.
Past ditching works and the 'canalisation' of the eastern section of the River Fal accelerate the movement of water across the site resulting in a surface drawdown in some areas. In 2011 a project to restore a 500 metre stretch of the River Fal at Tregoss was completed, this saw the river diverted out of its canalised channel onto the flood plain  into a channel which encompasses a newly constructed shallow channel and sections of historic meanders. Further hydrological restoration in the form of naturalising flows in ditches and canalised river channels, and blocking much smaller drains is desirable. Such restoration will raise water tables and increase wetland habitat, this work will also enhance Goss Moor's role in regulating river levels therefore managing flood events on the River Fal.
The required works will take place on the main River Fal channel (non EA) and two tributary channels of the River Fal. 
The requirement is to:
- Install current deflectors into the River Fal channel to encourage and speed up the creation of meanders to increase channel length and therefore retention time within the River Fal on Goss Moor.
-  Install leaky woody dams into the two tributary channels which will raise water levels to reduce the drawdown effect of the channels on the surrounding fen, while still allowing passage of wate

London boroughs, via sub-regional partnerships and London Councils, and the GLA have been working together on developing proposals for devolution and public service reform. These proposals cover a range of policy areas including adult skills. It is expected that the government will devolve the Adult Education Budget (AEB) to the Mayor from 2019/20 onwards. The GLA is working with boroughs, sub-regional partnerships and other stakeholders to develop a London Skills Strategy, part of which will inform the priorities for the devolved AEB. 
London local government is looking for additional independent support and expertise to work with us to: 
•	Identify a role and distinct focus for future ACL activity versus wider AEB funding delivered by FE colleges, boroughs and independent training providers, presenting a rationale for this and being clear how ACL fits into the wider employment and skills agenda. This should include identifying and prioritising the beneficiaries and activities of ACL provision, recognising the links to other key priorities for London such as social inclusion, health and well-being. The role and focus of ACL activity should be coherent and agreed at a pan-London level.
•	Develop an approach for commissioning ACL services so that they are effective, address need and have clear and measurable impact. The approach should identify the outcomes ACL services in London should deliver; and, following from that, how funding could be allocated to ACL services in London. The approach should clearly show how it could demonstrate improved impact of funding for ACL.
•	Identify what pan-London policies would be needed to support this approach.
•	Identify the available data and Labour Market Information (LMI) needed to underpin and deliver this approach and how this could this be used in the commissioning process.",2017-05-25T16:31:59+01:00,complete,CPV,73100000,"Research and experimental development services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,London,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25000,GBP,direct,,"Single tender action (below threshold)",,2017-06-12T23:59:59+01:00,2017-06-19T00:00:00+01:00,2017-10-20T23:59:59+01:00,1,1,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/wK4Q3PNF,"LONDON COUNCILS","LONDON COUNCILS",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/wK4Q3PNF,"59½ Southwark Street London SE1 0AL",London,"SE1 0AL",England,"sorcha rooney",Sorcha.Rooney@londoncouncils.gov.uk,,,buyer,GB-COH-08747426,"FE  Associats","FE  Associats",GB-COH,08747426,"FE Associates,

      The Communications Unit is seeking quotations from a design agency, to design, implement and host a new microsite and intranet site for the Sandwell Children's Trust. The microsite and intranet site will be standalone sites and will not form part of Sandwell Council's own website nor will it be associated with Sandwell council branding.
      
      The estimated contract value is £10,000.00 This Contract will be for a minimum of one and a maximum of three years in length.  However, the Council will shortly be transferring elements of its Children's Services to a trust.  Taking this into consideration, the Council will only be awarding and funding this arrangement for a 12 month period, but novating to the Trust at its inception.  It will then be at the discretion of the Trust, with regard to whether or not the Contract is extended for a further period (up to a maximum of three years).
      
      The Council will be using the In-tend e-Tendering System for this Procurement exercise, please visit https://in-tendhost.co.uk/sandwellmbc to access the Sandwell MBC In-tend Supplier Portal.

We are a cross-party organisation that works on behalf of all of our member authorities regardless of political persuasion.
London Councils makes the case to government, the Mayor and others to get the best deal for Londoners and to ensure that our member authorities have the resources, freedoms and powers to do the best possible job for their residents and local businesses.

London Councils runs a number of direct services for member authorities including the Freedom Pass, Taxicard and Health Emergency Badge. It also runs an independent parking appeals service and a pan-London grants programme for voluntary organisations.

London Councils acts as a catalyst for effective sharing among boroughs - be that ideas, good practice, people, resources, or policies and new approaches.

London Councils' members face a significant challenge in meeting the demand for housing from Londoners. Demand for homes increases by around 50,000 each year, yet delivery of new homes has been an average of 22,000 per annum. London Councils wishes to help its members increase their home building capacity to meet that challenge while enhancing the quality of life in our many communities. 

To this end and amongst a range of initiatives, London Councils is now seeking tenders to develop a business case and prospectus for a Collaborative Delivery Vehicle (CDV) for housing that is available for use on a voluntary basis by all London boroughs and the City of London Corporation.

This includes assessing business perceptions on how regulation is enforced and delivered in practice. Where possible we are keen to determine whether any improvement in the perception of the burden is potentially down to changes in Government policy and/or whether regulation is also impacting on growth.
It is a priority for BEIS to reduce regulatory burdens and improve the way regulation is delivered, in order to provide a regulatory environment that supports growth whilst maintaining protections.  Governments have announced their commitment through the introduction of a statutory Business Impact Target to help reduce the stock and flow of regulation. They have also undertaken initiatives to improve the business environment - through the Regulators' Code, the Growth Duty on regulators and cutting red tape reviews. It is important that the impact of these actions is tracked, and the BPS gives BEIS an opportunity to assess how far these measures have been felt by businesses and where there is a need to focus more effort.  
The survey also contributes to the Department's wider aims around business growth in terms of helping identify areas where regulatory burdens may be affecting business activities and what we might do to remove them and improve the regulatory environment. 2018 is an important year to run the survey because it provides a baseline before our exit from the EU.  (It also continues the biennial programme of previous surveys.)

The survey gathers intelligence for policy development - as results help identify areas where regulatory burdens may be affecting business activities and what we might do to remove them. The outputs can and have been used to determine our future focus and work programmes. The proposed questions on EU regulations would be valuable for informing our regulatory policies following EU exit.

In other cases the contracts are for journeys only operating on Monday to Saturday evenings, supplementing journeys operating on the same route on a commercial basis at other times of the day which do not form part of this contract.  Some contracts are for services operating at peak times only.  There are also in a small number of cases journeys that operate primarily for school travel purposes; special conditions will apply to those journeys.

Most of the contracts will require buses with a minimum of 16 seats, however a larger vehicle could be used, unless where specifically stated.  The vehicles required for these contracts will need to be wheelchair accessible, unless stated in the specification. 

The contracts will operate on a cost-based agreement under which fares revenue belongs to Durham County Council.  The contractor will be paid a fixed price per day and so does not bear any risk related to revenue.

1.	An assessment of which parts of the Film and Television industry Cornwall is best placed to develop and capture through a series of policy; infrastructure and business support mechanisms. This will be based on;
A desk-based analysis of the sector, which should include:  

•	A baseline analysis of the sector and assessment of trends in national and global markets
•	Emerging skills and capability gaps in the market
•	An assessment of CIoS's existing infrastructure -  business , skills and HE/FE assets 
•	An analysis of the barriers to growth of the sector in CIoS 
•	Alignment to local and national policy landscape i.e. the Industrial Strategy, Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Strategic Economic Plan, Cornwall  Council's White Paper for Culture, the Integrated Territorial Investment Strategy and the University's Strategic Plan.
•	An analysis of best practice (i.e. where public intervention has stimulated innovation and growth in the sector)

2.	Which interventions CIoS should prioritise to capture a share of appropriate market growth. Interventions might include;
a.	Policy - the application of appropriate tax breaks and incentives to attract both inward investment from the supply chain (post production / special effects) and the use of Cornwall as a film location. This should include the concept of a creative Enterprise Zone 
b.	Infrastructure - the potential development of facilities to support the growth of the sector. This should include, but not be limited to; incubation space; workspace; commercial facilities such as studios and post production in order to facilitate a high value cluster. This should include an assessment of demand and the scope / spec of a physical development.
c.	Business support - sector specific business support. This may include a new approach to supply chain simulation and support and equity return. It should also include an assessment of potential innovations and changes in HE/FE provision required to support the sub sectors identified in '1' above. The impact of a 'red carpet' film location service should also be reviewed. 

These outcomes should be delivered through a programme of engagement with key local and national players. This should include; Creative England; The British Film Institute; Creative Skillset and the Creative Industries Federation as well as existing local businesses such as;Tiger X; Dogbite Film Crew; Gorton Studios; Pixelrain; Beagle Create; Joint Effort; Cherry Cherry. We would anticipate national players to also be consulted. This may include; The Mill; MPC; Framestore; Halo Post; Molinaire.

The service is for a series of planned block bookings within each practice on a weekly basis.

The block booking face-to-face service currently covers 7 GP practices ONLY where demand for an individual language is high. These practices can choose whether to block book sessions or use the separate on-demand service (provided by a different Provider) and so the volume of activity is not guaranteed. 

The CCG commissions up to 242 hours of a face-to-face interpreting service per week across 7 practices for 52 weeks of the year.

The service is primarily for direct verbal communication between a patient / carer and the health care professional they are seeing. This may include helping the patient prioritise their issues prior to entering the consultation but the interpreter should not influence the patient in what they do or say and should therefore be a direct word-for-word interpretation.

The commissioners intend for the successful provider to work closely with each GP Practice to develop a collaborative approach to service delivery.

An understanding of the current hard and soft factors influencing relocation is required to drive growth across the country. Up to date evidence is needed to inform any policy making that would influence incentives around firm relocation decisions, as well as informing policymakers on which barriers faced by firms wishing to expand are the most significant.
Additionally, a better understanding on the drivers of firm relocation will inform the work on retaining companies within the country as the UK leaves the European Union and attracting new foreign direct investment. There is clear overlap between this and the factors influencing where businesses wishing to start and grow choose to locate.
Objectives
1.	To update the evidence base on why some firms choose to relocate all their business or some functions and what drives their locational choice in a modern economy. 
2.	To extend the existing research to cover more sectors of the economy, reflecting changes in sectorial composition of the country since the 1970s.
3.	To compare the drivers of relocation between different types of companies (for instance by business size, sector, and ownership).
4.	To review the evidence on attractiveness of different UK locations, and the UK more generally

Policy development requires good and up to date supporting evidence. Out of date evidence makes it difficult to confidently assess the potential effectiveness of policy options to influence the location of firms across the country, whether relocating from within the UK or from overseas. Timely evidence on the specific reasons why companies may choose to relocate part or all of their operations outside of the UK is also required.
Research is therefore needed to update the existing evidence base, informing policy making to deliver the UK's industrial strategy and the Local Industrial strategies
Research Questions
1.	What are the main reasons that cause companies to choose to relocate?
2.	Which are the most important considerations that relocating companies make when choosing a new location, whether within the UK or overseas?
3.	How do the drivers of company relocation differ between domestic and international companies, between different firms of different sizes, sectors, and growth ambitions, and between different ownership and operational structures?
4.	What are the relocation trends, in terms of businesses are moving away from certain local areas to others?
5.	What are the elements that different UK locations, and the UK more generally, attractive for businesses",,complete,CPV,73200000,"Research and development consultancy services",CPV,79300000,"Market and economic research; polling and statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,London,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,80000,GBP,selective,,"Call-off from a framework agreement",,2017-11-08T23:59:59Z,2017-11-15T00:00:00Z,2018-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED","UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"Polaris House, North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FL",England,,research@uksbs.co.uk,,,buyer,GB-COH-07608279,"ECONOMIC INSIGHT LIMITED","ECONOMIC INSIGHT LIMITED",GB-COH,07608279,"125 Old Broad Street

More specifically we would like to understand whether buybacks are being used (by design or accident) to artificially meet EPS targets in CEO pay contracts and/or to inflate the value of their share awards rather than to create long-tem value for the company.
As explained above, this work will:
•	deliver the Government's manifesto commitment ""to commission an examination of the use of share buybacks to ensure that they cannot be used artificially to hit performance targets and inflate executive pay"" that has been reaffirmed by the BEIS response to the Corporate Governance Reform green paper, published on 29th August. It will help government come to a conclusion on whether there exists a significant problem, if so what it is, and what further steps might be necessary; and
•	contribute to current work on corporate governance reform, executive pay and investor stewardship, including potentially influencing revisions to the UK Corporate Governance Code and UK Stewardship Code.
The project should seek to answer the following questions:
•	To what extent have share buybacks (by design or accident) helped meet EPS and total shareholder return (TSR) targets? 
•	Are share repurchases used by executives to meet performance targets such as EPS and TSR, and to boost share based remuneration levels by creating (short-term) increases in share price? Does the academic literature suggest that the use of buybacks to meet targets is relevant to the UK?
•	Do performance targets such as EPS and TSR incentivise the use of share buybacks for myopic reasons that are not value creating for the company?
•	How important are performance related measures, such as, EPS and TSR to CEOs overall pay plan and how has this evolved over time? 
•	Does the United States regulatory framework on buybacks and the typical pay structure for US CEOs result in a stronger use of buybacks to manipulate executive pay in the US than in the UK, or does the evidence suggest that these problems exist in the UK to a similar degree?
The work should aim to answer these questions by examining the existing literature and by carrying out its own analysis based on up-to-date UK-specific data. It should also analyse the different regulatory frameworks in the US and the UK, and assess to what extent the existing US evidence applies to the UK (please refer to the section ""Suggested Methodology"" for more detail on the three suggested components of the project).
The successful bidder may also indicate what basic steps could be taken to avoid share buybacks being misused to inflate executive remuneration, should the analysis suggest that this was indeed the case. This additional step is though optional.

The ONS will shortly be running a tender exercise for support with design changes as illustrated below.
      
      Overview
      The National Survey of Wales which is undertaken by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) requires support with design changes of existing materials which are sent out with the survey questionnaire.  The design changes are to be completed by an external supplier, which then submit back to ONS to review and printed internally. This service was previously undertaken within ONS through the internal design department, but they no longer have the capacity to undertake this work, so this service will now be taken externally.  
      
      Requirement
      The National Survey for Wales leaflet and letter has undergone a pilot which has been designed and implemented, however the main stage material will require a number of small changes in the coming months.  The National Survey for Wales requires a design company that can implement changes written in English and Welsh to existing documents and then send them back in printer PDF formats to allow internal companies to print.  All changes will be clearly drafted in ONS including the Welsh translation.
      As this is a monthly survey this will be time critical, to allow new materials to be issued the following month. 
      
      Currently the materials used are A4, which are printed double sided, with one side in English and the other with the Welsh Translation.
      
      If you are interested in this opportunity or have an recommendations then please register through the ONS e-tendering portal, In-Tend.

Green/Masala bonds with access to private capital at scale through the international bond markets can offer lower cost of capital compared to domestic bank lending covering various climate sensitive projects and green infrastructure investments in railways, renewable energy, water infrastructure, low carbon buildings and many other sectors. 
The British High Commission had been promoting green/masala bonds as well as the city of London as a preferential and eases to access capital market for Indian issuers. Our efforts in led some prominent Indian business taking the green bond route to meet their financial requirement e.g. NTPC - $300m (listed in London issuing the world's first ""green masala bond"" in London (a green bond issuing in Indian Rupees), Axis Bank - $500m (again listed in London stock exchange). Our support also assisted in shaping up the India-UK green finance forum, which is now actively engaged in formulating Green Bonds regulation in India. The phase (II) of this support is meant to accelerate the ongoing momentum on green bond and to closely work with key stakeholders in GOI for promoting the India-UK green finance forum as a government to government forum.
