These events need to be delivered regionally across locations in England and Wales and cover the full range of heat network topics, which includes both technical and commercial aspects of heat network development. Although we anticipate the need for sector specialists for specific events, we require the contractor(s) to evidence knowledge and experience of the heat network sector. This will enable the contractor(s) to organise relevant events as soon as the contract is awarded; have the ability to deliver generic heat network topic areas; be able to engage sufficiently with the market and tap into their own connections; and ensure messaging is in line with current policy whilst requiring minimal HNDU resource. 

The number of events will be demand led and based on HNDU’s requirements; however we anticipate roughly one event per month for the duration of the 24 Month contract. We will discuss events over the contract period, but the contractor(s) must be able to deliver events at short notice if an urgent need to communicate to the sector is required.

Additional information: We have introduced a new electronic tendering system called CSW-JETS (Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire’s Joint E-Tendering System). In order for you to do business with us for this contract and in the future you must register on the system by following the link below and then clicking the ‘register here’ button. 

www.csw-jets.co.uk

CSW-JETS is the new sub-regional e-tendering portal run by In-tend.  Since February 2010, Coventry, Solihull, Warwickshire, Nuneaton & Bedworth and Rugby Councils have been working together as a shared procurement service. Along with Solihull Community Housing, we have joined together to bring you a collaborative E-Tendering portal. 

CSW-JETS enables us to advertise our opportunities across all authorities through the same system. This means that there is a single point of contact for procurement in the sub-region so you only have to register once to receive notifications for all authorities. Registering on the portal will make it easier for local suppliers to find, respond to and be alerted to tender opportunities. 

Registration is free, and takes just a few minutes. When complete, you will be able to express interest in any of the Councils’/Authorities’ opportunities when they are made available. In addition, we will be able to access your details whenever we have a requirement, and you may then be invited to tender or quote for work.

The main training salon “Creative Solutions” and the commercial Salon “Stars” allow students to gain hands-on work experience working with real clients.

To provide a housing support service to Licensees who are experiencing or recovering from the effects of living with domestic abuse for the purpose of developing that person’s capacity to live independently in accommodation or sustaining their capacity to do so.

To work with clients and other relevant agencies to provide support and a planned approach to resettlement/move on where the needs arise. This will include the countywide domestic abuse services.

To provide a service that prevents the loss of accommodation and avoids the unnecessary use of higher intensity services.

The aim of the research is to review the success and challenges of the FoE and RTC programmes, informing BRE and BIS how we can build on positive outcomes, as well as understanding the barriers that effect reform and how these might be best tackled for future reviews. We aim to learn about the experience from both businesses and regulators. Developing an understanding of regulators approach to interpreting reforms and involvement in implementation of changes, could provide insight in to the best way to develop a transferrable model for the process of implementing review findings in to reforms.

Overall, it is anticipated that there will be growth of approximately 6 000 students, mostly undergraduates. This number will include c. 1 700 students who are being relocated from the Queen's Campus in Stockton-on-Tees, as the University seeks to consolidate its education and research activities onto the Durham City campus.
 As part of a supporting strategy of estate development, the University has identified a need for additional student residential accommodation. To deliver part of this additional need the University has acquired the Mount Oswald site with the benefit of outline planning consent for 1 000 bedspaces. As a Collegiate University, colleges form a major part of the delivery of the Wider Student Experience, and therefore the University is looking to deliver the new accommodation at Mount Oswald through the design and construction of two new colleges, each of approximately 500 self-catered student bedrooms, plus associated college infrastructure and common space.
 This procurement brings to the market the opportunity to take forward the delivery of the two new colleges and the associated accommodation on the basis of a design, build, finance and operate model.
 The Mount Oswald site is well located close to other colleges, the Durham University Business School (DUBS) and the main University campus. The new accommodation will include a mixture of en-suite and shared bathroom bedrooms arranged in cluster flats and town houses to meet the varying needs of the college students, including first year and returning under-graduate and post-graduate students. An important element will be the provision of social and study space, together with college administration facilities.
 The University's preference is for the delivery of both
 colleges as early as possible, with at least 700
 bedrooms, plus all the associated social and
 college administration facilities being available for
 occupation by the commencement of the 2019/20
 academic year, any balance to take the bedroom
 numbers up to the total of 1 000 to be available by the commencement of the 2020/21 academic year.
 The duration of the contract is to be up to a potential maximum of 50 years (from practical completion of the colleges). Ongoing operation of the colleges will include the successful bidder delivering hard FM services and some or all of the soft FM services, with the University delivering any balance. The exact allocation of soft FM Services will be determined during the dialogue phase of the procurement.
