This project will support businesses interested in the Medical Technologies (MedTech) and Healthcare market by providing them with access to market-specific expertise. Business Bridge will support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire.
      
      The Framework Agreement is divided into four lots covering specific areas of expertise and the University envisage appointing up to three Service Providers in each lot although the University reserves the right to vary this number. Tenderers can bid for one or more lots. Further information on each of the lots is given in the Tender Specification in Section 2 of the invitation to tender (ITT).
      
      The University is conducting a below threshold procurement exercise (ie below the OJEU services threshold) to establish the Framework Agreement for the Business Bridge Experts Panel. Tenderers will be deemed to understand the procurement process which the University is following particularly in relation to the public procurement rules.
      
      Business Bridge (Project Reference 32R16P00713) is part funded from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) as part of the European Structural and Investment Funds England Growth Programme 2014-2020. 
      
      Whilst the Framework Agreement has a budget of ?130,000, no guarantee is given as to the levels of expenditure under the framework and within each lot.
      
      The scope of services required under the Framework Agreement is detailed in the Tender Specification in Section 2 of the ITT. The University will call-off pieces of work under the framework either by:
      
      o Directly awarding the work to one of the framework Service Providers without reopening competition  OR
      o By carrying out a further competition with the framework Services Providers in the given lot to which the work requirement relates.
      
      The University will take into account the quantity, value or characteristics of the services required when determining the method of call-off for a given piece of work. The choice of the method of call-off for a given piece of work will be down to the sole discretion of the University.",,complete,CPV,79410000,"Business and management consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"ST5 5BG",,,"West Midlands","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,130000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2017-05-19T23:59:59+01:00,2017-07-06T00:00:00+01:00,2018-12-31T23:59:59Z,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-55515,"Keele University","Keele University",,,"Keele, Staffordshire","West Midlands","ST5 5BG","United Kingdom","Darren  Pearce",d.pearce@keele.ac.uk,"01782 734124",,buyer,GB-CFS-63095,"Accelerate Marketing and Market Research Ltd","Accelerate Marketing and Market Research Ltd","Jupiter House, Drummond Road, Stafford, Staffordshire, United Kingdom, ST16 3HJ",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63096,"bitjam limited","bitjam limited","Studio 31, Spode Works, Elenora Street, Staffordshire, United Kingdom, ST4 1QD",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63097,"Conviso Ltd","Conviso Ltd","31 Bow Green Road, Cheshire, United Kingdom, WA14 3LR",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63098,"DHC Informatics Ltd","DHC Informatics Ltd","Cross Street Business Centre, 43a Cross Street, Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, United Kingdom, DE14 1EF",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63099,"Healthcare Print and Packaging","Healthcare Print and Packaging","Bio City, Nottingham, United Kingdom, NG2 5hy",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63100,"JG Technology Management Ltd","JG Technology Management Ltd","Little Blakelow, Bottom Lane, Ipstones, Staffordshire Moorlands, United Kingdom, ST10 2LN",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63101,"Kirkstall Precision Ltd","Kirkstall Precision Ltd","Unit G6 Wyther Lane Industrial Estate, Wyther lane, Leeds, West Yorkshire, United Kingdom, LS5 3AR",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63102,"Lucideon Limited","Lucideon Limited","Queens Road, Penkhull, Stoke on Trent, Staffordshire, United Kingdom, ST4 7LQ",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63103,"Pym's Consultancy Ltd","Pym's Consultancy Ltd","2 Beech Close, Heckington, Sleaford, United Kingdom, NG34 9FT",large,,supplier,GB-CFS-63104,"Three Circles Consulting Limited","Three Circles Consulting Limited","114 Broad Lane, Stapeley, Nantwich, Cheshire, United Kingdom, CW5 7QW",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-55515,"Keele University",ocds-b5fd17-19032b32-e595-46d4-afe8-e0302009da83-1,active,2017-06-30T00:00:00+01:00,2017-07-27T19:45:33+01:00,0,GBP,GB-CFS-63095,"Accelerate Marketing and Market Research Ltd",GB-CFS-63096,"bitjam limited",GB-CFS-63097,"Conviso Ltd",GB-CFS-63098,"DHC Informatics Ltd",GB-CFS-63099,"Healthcare Print and Packaging",GB-CFS-63100,"JG Technology Management Ltd",GB-CFS-63101,"Kirkstall Precision Ltd",GB-CFS-63102,"Lucideon Limited",GB-CFS-63103,"Pym's Consultancy Ltd",GB-CFS-63104,"Three Circles Consulting Limited",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-07-06T00:00:00+01:00,2018-12-31T23:59:59Z,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/cd5dd55a-a17a-49e2-bb50-a64c08204413,2017-07-27T19:45:33+01:00,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The service user support services will include the provision of:

Accommodation
Accommodation is provided to support asylum applicants and their dependents who would otherwise be destitute. Accommodation is to be provided by the service provider(s) covering a number of regions in the UK. Accommodation provision is through local authorities, private and other accommodation providers e.g. housing associations. Accommodation is paid for on the basis of usage only, with the provider taking the void risk.
Three types of accommodation services required are:
1.	Initial accommodation where a destitute asylum applicant and their dependents will reside before a decision is made on their support claim. 
2.	Dispersal accommodation where an asylum applicant's claim for asylum support has been approved, they and their dependents are moved to dispersal accommodation whilst their asylum claim and any subsequent appeal are processed.
3.	Accommodation for failed asylum applicants and immigration detainees released on bail who may be eligible for support if there is a legitimate barrier to their removal.

Transport
Transport is provided for asylum applicants and their dependents during their asylum application process to ensure they arrive at required destinations for interview appointments. 
Service users needing accommodation are transported from the point of claim to the allocated site on the initial accommodation estate.
Once a claim for support has been agreed the service users are transported from initial accommodation to the assigned dispersal address.
Project Vision
Asylum Accommodation and Support Contract aims to deliver a VfM and affordable accommodation and support system which effectively delivers the UK's statutory and international obligations to asylum seekers, supporting the operation of effective immigration controls. 

The system will ensure the safety and security of service users and their host communities. Services will be delivered as consistently & efficiently as possible at a level which is proportionate in comparison with the services offered to UK nationals:  
•	Service users will experience an accessible and easy to navigate system, which delivers consistent and compassionate support. The system will protect the vulnerable, keep service users safe, orientate them to live in their communities and prepare them to act on the outcome of their asylum claim.
•	Providers will supply a service of which they are proud, securing a broad supply of accommodation and appropriate support services. The department will take practical steps to give them greater certainty on demand, with a sustainable balance of risk, an appropriate rate of return and scope for innovation in delivery.
•	Communities will feel involved in the support of destitute asylum seekers, working in partnership with UKVI.

      The site has been used by Travis Perkins for the last 20+ years, and has been a constant within an ever changing demographic of the area. 
      
      Due to the expansion of a number of businesses of a similar nature within the Slough Trading Estate, Travis Perkins has agreed to sell the freehold to Slough Borough Council (SBC). 
      
      The purchase of the land was completed on 16th June 2017 and SBC, along with the partnership of Slough Urban Renewal (SUR), are proposing a development of residential properties on the land. 
      
      The Slough Basin Warehouse structures will need to be demolished as soon as practically possible.
       
      SBC/SUR hope to be in a position to have the area ready for development by early 2018.

Additional information: We have introduced a new electronic tendering system called CSW-JETS (Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire's Joint E-Tendering System). In order for you to do business with us in the future you must register on the system by following the link below and then clicking the 'register here' button. 

www.csw-jets.co.uk

CSW-JETS is the new sub-regional e-tendering portal run by In-tend.  Since February 2010, Coventry, Solihull, Warwickshire, Nuneaton & Bedworth and Rugby Councils have been working together as a shared procurement service. Along with Solihull Community Housing, we have joined together to bring you a collaborative E-Tendering portal. 

CSW-JETS enables us to advertise our opportunities across all authorities through the same system. This means that there is a single point of contact for procurement in the sub-region so you only have to register once to receive notifications for all authorities. Registering on the portal will make it easier for local suppliers to find, respond to and be alerted to tender opportunities. 

Registration is free, and takes just a few minutes. When complete, you will be able to express interest in any of the Councils'/Authorities' opportunities when they are made available.

Additional information: We have introduced a new electronic tendering system called CSW-JETS (Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire's Joint E-Tendering System). In order for you to do business with us in the future you must register on the system by following the link below and then clicking the 'register here' button. 

www.csw-jets.co.uk

CSW-JETS is the new sub-regional e-tendering portal run by In-tend.  Since February 2010, Coventry, Solihull, Warwickshire, Nuneaton & Bedworth and Rugby Councils have been working together as a shared procurement service. Along with Solihull Community Housing, we have joined together to bring you a collaborative E-Tendering portal. 

CSW-JETS enables us to advertise our opportunities across all authorities through the same system. This means that there is a single point of contact for procurement in the sub-region so you only have to register once to receive notifications for all authorities. Registering on the portal will make it easier for local suppliers to find, respond to and be alerted to tender opportunities. 

Registration is free, and takes just a few minutes. When complete, you will be able to express interest in any of the Councils'/Authorities' opportunities when they are made available. In addition, we will be able to access your details whenever we have a requirement, and you may then be invited to tender or quote for work.

It will include a Chapel to seat over 120 mourners, a Flower Court and a landscaped Garden of Remembrance. Provisions also include car parking for 150 vehicles and a separate waiting area. Works also include a new access of the A267.
      
      In the past the residents of Wealden have always had to travel outside the District to attend cremations. As pressure on these services grows, there is an increasing need for local families and friends to be able to mourn their loved ones in an unhurried, peaceful setting, without the additional stress of travelling long distances.
      
      The contemporary single storey design will use stone, glass and water to provide a contemplative setting within the folds of the local landscape. 
      
      The new crematorium will be constructed at Horeham Flat Farm, Chiddingly Road, Horam, East Sussex TN21 0JL.
      
      Works are anticipated to begin in September with an anticipated contract length of 60 weeks.

A Market Engagement event is to be held on 16th August 2017. 
NHS England has set a goal for all hospitals with an A&E department in England to have a ""comprehensive front door streaming"" service in place. Therefore the CCGs are looking into commissioning  a GP led front-door clinical streaming service to make care more efficient and take pressure away from emergency departments, by having a primary healthcare professional ""stream"" patients coming through hospital doors, who can then refer them to primary healthcare or an emergency department.
The aim of the market event will be to engage with potential providers for these services in order to share the commissioning intentions of the CCGs, and to seek input from providers on a number of important aspects relating to the procurement of the services, including the service specification and adopting an innovative partnership approach' for the procurement of the service.  
The CCGs would like to assess current market appetite to provide this service and identify any barriers to successful implementation. The outcomes from this event will then be used in consideration of next steps.
The event will be held on Wednesday 16th August 2017 from 5pm - 7pm. 
Location: Staffordshire Place 1, Tipping Street, Stafford, ST16 2DH.  
Providers wishing to attend this event must book a place and allocate up to two representatives only, by 5pm on Friday 11th August 2017.
To book a place at the event  please email: Elizabeth.johnson1@nhs.net and olena.florek@nhs.net. 
The booking email should state the name and job title of the persons wishing to attend, organisation name, contact email addresses, contact telephone numbers.

Additional information: It should be noted that this is not a procurement exercise at this stage and participating organisations are responsible for their own costs.
This future procurement is for clinical services which are Light Touch Regime services for the purpose of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 as specified in Schedule 3 of the Regulations (""Regulations"").

We want to create a suite of videos that will help prospective students understand two key things:
•	How special it is to study in the vibrant, creative environment of Falmouth
•	What their day-to-day life will be like (what their course covers, what the facilities are like and how long they're expected to spend on campus)

Each video will focus on one course or group of similar courses and will illustrate 'a day in the life' of a student on that course; that could encompass waking up in student accommodation, using the many different facilities and resources that are available, interacting with academic staff, eating on campus and socializing with friends.

Clearly pitched at 16 - 19 year olds, the videos should also reflect both the University's brand and core values of 'creative, courageous and connected'. The films should be professional, high quality, engaging, informative and impactful. We want Falmouth to stand out from our competitors and for the viewer to be excited about the prospect of studying at Falmouth.

Additional information: All correspondence, tenders, associated documents etc. (whether before or after the final submission of tender) are to be directed through the procurement e -mail address procurement@fxplus.ac.uk
All requests for clarification or communications relating to the Tender must be submitted by the deadline via the E-mail address FAO Anna Brown and with the procurement reference number clearly referenced 929Falmouth.

A Community and Home Care Fast Response Service is commissioned on behalf of those who require their care and support needs to be met in their own home and to support them to access the local community. The Community and Home Care Fast Response Service will be accessed by adults of all ages who experience dementia, learning disabilities, sensory loss, autistic spectrum disorders, mental and emotional distress, and/or severe physical impairment, acquired brain injury and older people. It will be necessary for all beneficiaries to have had a Community Care Assessment and be defined by Adult Care Management as being in need of care or/and support. The need for care and support is defined in line with the Council's Eligibility Criteria, which currently equates to people with substantial and critical needs and any other policy and guidance that supersedes current regulation and guidance. Community and Home Care Fast Response Service - Current Service Delivery by the Incumbent Provider: Type of Contract: Block Contract Provided by: 2 x Mobile Care Workers Capacity: Total 10 hours per day made up of 8hrs actual contact time plus 2 hrs travel time Service Provision: A stand by service, available 365 days per year, within the hours of 7am and 10 pm, over a period of no more than 72 hours per service user. In the year 1st Sept 2015 to 31st Aug 2016 service was provided to 203 service users who required service to expedite hospital discharge. There were 68 days when the service was not utilised at all. On average the service is used for 1.25 hrs per day. Going forward the underutilised capacity will support the delivery of urgent response to people residing at home and requiring care and support. Primary Service Objective - facilitate hospital discharge by providing home care service to people who require a contracted service (i.e. services appointed to the Community and Home Care Service Framework) and when the contracted service is unable to accept referral as a result of high demand i.e. winter pressures. The service is flexible and responds to request for service for people situated at home where there are service capacity issues due to unforeseen circumstances such as contract compliance action against another provider and to prevent admission to hospital or residential care. Rotherham MBC reserve the right to utilise secured hours as they see fit. Bidders must note that Consortium bids will not be accepted for this opportunity.

The fundamental question to be answered by this research is: what would workers affected by NLW and NMW increases have earned in the absence of government intervention (i.e. assuming no further increase from the current NMW, NLW rate). This counterfactual question covers both wage level of those on NMW, NLW and wage growth of those on NMW, NLW in the absence of the annual uprating. Given that the minimum wage is nationally applicable, the pure counterfactual is unobservable and so final recommendations must be based on a thorough assessment of the theory and evidence.

As part of the process of developing a Local Plan, it has begun gathering evidence to inform key land use planning issues.

32% of the borough is designated as either Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), collectively amounting to some 1,184 hectares. This forms part of the Metropolitan Green Belt and London-wide MOL network. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) explains that the Green Belt designation aims to prevent urban sprawl and keep land permanently open and the London Plan explains that the NPPF's Green Belt policies should apply to MOL.  

The NPPF allows Councils to alter Green Belt in exceptional circumstances through the preparation of the Local Plan and the London Plan also allows Councils to alter MOL boundaries through the Local Plan process.

Given that the Green Belt and MOL designations cover a significant part of the borough and National and London-wide policy requirements, RBK will need robust evidence to justify the approach that the Council takes with regards to the Green Belt and MOL boundaries in its Local Plan.

The Council wishes to appoint a suitably qualified consultancy to undertake a Green Belt and MOL Assessment to help inform the preparation of its Local Plan.

The Assessment will provide the Council with an understanding of:
a)	how different parts of the Green Belt fulfil the purposes of Green Belt designation as set out in paragraph 80 of the NPPF or how different parts of MOL meet the criteria set out in Policy 7.17 of the London Plan;
b)	in light of the findings of A) which parts of the Council's Green Belt or MOL (if any) could be considered further for removal from the Green Belt or MOL; and
c)	whether any additional land should be considered for designation as Green Belt or MOL, having regard to the advice set out in the NPPF or London Plan, as relevant.

It is also expected that the report will show an understanding of the role that Green Belt and MOL within Kingston plays as part of the whole Metropolitan Green Belt and London-wide MOL network and an awareness of other Green Belt Assessments (or similar) that have been undertaken by neighbouring local authorities. It should also refer to relevant case law relating the Green Belt or MOL.

It is anticipated that the Contract will be awarded in April 2017 with an anticipated contract start date of 12th April or thereabouts. The contract term will end when all work has been completed and the Council receives copies of an agreed final version of the Strategy in printed and electronic formats.",2017-03-15T10:15:18Z,complete,CPV,71400000,"Urban planning and landscape architectural services",CPV,90712100,"Urban environmental development planning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,London,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,25000,GBP,30000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2017-04-03T23:59:59+01:00,2017-04-10T00:00:00+01:00,2017-09-11T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-59814,"The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames","The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames",,,"Guildhall, High Street",Kingston,"KT1 1EU","United Kingdom","Phil Gardener",phil.gardener@kingston.gov.uk,"+44 2085475392",http://www.kingston.gov.uk,buyer,GB-CFS-63037,"Amec Foster Wheeler","Amec Foster Wheeler","CV32 6JX",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-59814,"The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames",ocds-b5fd17-2527d78e-3353-4baf-8cf6-9350da004c27-1,active,2017-07-17T00:00:00+01:00,2017-07-27T14:07:27+01:00,21569,GBP,GB-CFS-63037,"Amec Foster Wheeler",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-07-18T00:00:00+01:00,2017-11-30T23:59:59Z,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/d1422ad7-5bea-466c-91e2-d6907489320f,2017-07-27T14:07:27+01:00,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In depth market research has been conducted and has identified a significant gap in the market for an institution of our calibre.  We have been working closely with Dubai's Knowledge and Human Development Agency (KHDA) over the last year and have already been granted approval to deliver a range of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes.
      
      Plans are in place to open Phase 1 of the campus, using a refurbished building within the existing DIAC structure, which will open in late 2017, with teaching programmes commencing in September 2018 for an initial cohort of 250-300 students.  The intention is to grow student numbers within the Phase 1 building up to 600, before moving into our own purpose-built Phase 2 campus in 2020.  The Phase 2 campus will allow us to grow at a greater pace by adding additional degree programmes, with a rapid ramp up to 4,500 by year 7.
      
      In order to deliver Phase 2 - the full campus in Dubai - the University is seeking a collaborator.

The Landscaper must have a strong understanding of the horticultural standards that the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (RBG, Kew) strives to uphold and the necessity to complete their work on time, as any delay will have a knock on effect for planting. Experience in working in CSCS carded sites is a must, alongside demonstration of a strong ability in the co-ordination and managing of different elements of a scheme to deliver on time and to agreed standards.
RBG, Kew and the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLA) engaged Turner Townsend (TT) and ISG to undertake the renovation of the Temperate House being the world's largest existing Victorian glasshouse. ISG have experienced set-backs in their programme which has led to a reduction of time RBG, Kew's horticultural team will have to undertake the landscaping and planting within the glasshouse. Thus the decision has been taken to contract some of the work out to a landscaping company in order to ensure the glasshouse is opened to the public in May 2018.
Responsibilities include:
•	 De-compact existing sub base levels, removing extraneous material, level and grade
•	 Install (liaising and coordinating with ISG and TT, using their site requirements) previously procured growing media, grade and landscape all beds to RBG, Kew's specifications
•	 Move from storage previously identified rocks and install in beds as directed by RBG, Kew's horticulture staff
•	 Assist RBG, Kew horticulturists to bring in and plant specimens over 100 litre pot size, to be completed concurrently with rock and soil installation.
•	 Install water features, water feature treatment plant and irrigation rings with control equipment. Designs will be provided by RBG, Kew, the appointed contractor will need to provide a detailed methodology for how to achieve the desired results. 
•	There is an option to turf or seed the grass apron round the outside of the building

The Civil Service Fast Stream is an established 4-year programme aimed at recruiting and developing the next generation of leaders. In 2015 the Authority launched a communications Fast Stream that follows the 4-year programme and focuses on communications and leadership skills. At the end of the 4 years, participants are expected to reach senior management level.
To progress the Fast Stream (FS) programme, the Authority is looking to provide a professional qualification awarded by a chartered body, for students in their third year. The majority of specialist Fast Stream schemes have a qualification or accreditation built in, for example, Finance, HR and Project Delivery. Developing a communications FS qualification would ensure consistency with other professions. Developing professional leaders is part of the wider Civil Service strategy to improve standards across all functions.

      The primary objective of this project is to estimate survival rate of discarded juvenile and adult thornback ray (Raja clavata) caught in the Thames thornback ray otter trawl fishery. The information may be used to support an application for exemption from the Landing Obligation (LO) under the high survival provision.
      
      The information on thornback ray discard survival may be used to supplement management advice, in particular in constructing Discard Plans and evidencing applications for exemptions to the Landing Obligation (LO) for thornback ray under the high survival provision.
      
      The trials will take place between July 2017 and October 2017. The work will involve a maximum of 6 days of fishing under charter, possibly spread over several weeks, with a possible routine of a few day's fishing followed by several days monitoring the survival of thornback ray returned to an onshore tank system. 
      
      The study will involve the capture and release of live thornback ray that have been tagged using data storage tags, as well as the retention and landing of live thornback ray in tanks for captive monitoring studies. The survey will require two scientist to be onboard the vessel while fishing.
      
      This tender is seeking an otter trawler, with a skipper experienced in fishing for thornback ray in the Thames study area.

      Our objectives and requirements

The Day Opportunities Service will be accessed by adults requiring specialist support and have learning disabilities, sensory impairment, autistic spectrum disorders, multiple physical disability, complex needs (including complex behavioural issues), epilepsy, dementia and additional mental ill health (associated with any of the described categories). Individuals with acquired brain injury may where appropriate be referred to the service.
Day opportunities include a wide range of group and individual activities. They may take place in a specific building, and include support to access universal facilities. Day opportunities will usually take place away from the home environment and will promote social interaction and opportunities to be as independent as possible while people pursue their interests and take part in meaningful activities. Service Users will be supported in a number of different areas including activities to meet and make friends and use leisure and recreational facilities, education, volunteering, paid supported employment and social enterprise activity.
The Council wishes to establish a Framework Agreement to secure a range of Day Opportunities Services. Contractors commissioned to deliver against this service specification are appointed to a Framework Agreement with the Council. We expect each Contractor appointed to the Framework to demonstrate in detail how they can deliver a quality Day Opportunities Service.
The Council does not guarantee the volume or right to any business or referrals under this Framework Agreement.
The Council will 'call off' from the Framework Agreement with defined volumes of service and according to the individual Service User requirements defined in a Support Plan.The opportunity to become an approved provider under this framework agreement is open to a range of providers capable of delivering skilled support which may include personal care for adults who are aged 18 and over.
This tender is separated into 2 lots:
-
Lot 1 - Building based services
-
Lot 2 - Community based - outreach services
Tenderers are not restricted to applying for 1 Lot.
Incumbent Contractors who are successful at the point of tender award will retain their existing Service Users.
Estimated value £950,000 per annum. However this does not carry any guarantee of turnover and any estimated volumes of business are indicative and may vary upwards or downwards depending on actual future needs.
