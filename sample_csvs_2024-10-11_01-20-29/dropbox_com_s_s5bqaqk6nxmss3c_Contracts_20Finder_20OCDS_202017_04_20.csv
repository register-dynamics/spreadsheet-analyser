As well as searching for and finding a range of training, mentoring and resources that will support individuals to navigate the challenges and maximise the opportunities within the education and training sector, the ELMAG portal is an online community of leaders, managers and those involved in governance who seek to support their own professional development and that of others; not just through training and development courses but also through peer-to-peer dialogue, networking, coaching and mentoring, reading and reflection.
The ELMAG portal was launched in July 2015, and with our delivery partners, we want to ensure its continued development and growth will enable it to be a valuable resource to the sector. The portal can be found on www.elmag.org.uk.
The portal was upgraded, with a new look to the site and improved functionality.  A delivery partner was sought to maintain the existing ELMAG portal including improvements to it. The site will maintain high quality content; be user-friendly and intuitive but with support available for visitors as well as partners who post course information on the portal. The undertaking of a quality assurance function will also be provided.

6 contracts were awarded by the Foundation to build on its current Continuous Professional Development (CPD) programme offered through the Maths and English Pipelines 1, 2 and 3, which in turn will build on the maths and English Enhancement Programmes, which provide a combination of resources and training for Functional Skills and GCSE teachers in maths and English as well as vocational teachers.
At the heart of effective practice in these subjects is strong and effective leadership.  This tender was built on the Foundation's existing work to support leadership and management.
Within the context of the apprenticeship reforms and the government's target to deliver 3 million apprentices by 2020, our Future Apprenticeships programme will help managers, teachers, trainers, leaders and those involved in governance to make the transition from apprenticeship frameworks to delivery of the new apprenticeship standards.
As part of this work, there will be development and delivery of a range of courses to support practitioners to embed maths and English in the new apprenticeship standards. The courses will support teachers and trainers from a range of providers across the sector on how to work closely with employers, sub-contractors and learners for effective maths and English provision. They will support practitioners to tailor learning to individuals in their industry and training context.
Pipeline IV will work with the sector to support improvements in the quality of teaching and learning in maths and English from entry levels to GCSE and beyond in a range of settings (including further education colleges, independent training providers, workplaces, community learning, third sector and offender learning).  In particular we wish to see marked improvements in the delivery of teaching and in learners' motivation and achievement in:

Context
Building Better Opportunities sees the Big Lottery Fund matching funds from European Social Fund (ESF) 2014-2020, to provide joint investment in local projects that tackle poverty and promote social inclusion and drive local jobs and growth.
 
ESIF strategy for the North East LEP area

The North East LEP area's European Structural and Investment Fund Strategy for 2014 - 2020 identifies strategic weaknesses for the region to address. 

Amongst them are:

•	Employment and inclusion 
•	Skills 
•	Enterprise rates 
•	Digital connectivity 
The strategy recognises that 'employment is the key route to combating poverty and exclusion' and points out the relatively high levels of unemployment and economic inactivity
Groundwork NE & Cumbria is the lead partner for BBO in County Durham.  Working with 11 voluntary and community sector delivery partners Reaching Out Across Durham (ROAD) will target 625 of the hardest to reach and provide them with intensive support and advice to help them move towards employment and or training.  ROAD will also develop new services that our participant's will be able to access including health, financial and digital inclusion activities as well as supporting them to access existing services

To do this we have set out a strategy for public service reform and improved health and wellness that is built on an asset based approach to working with communities called the Deal for the Future.

Phase one of our sexual health consultation ran from December 2016 to January 2017. We consulted with over 300 people including members of the public, service providers and key partners on the current sexual health services and the opportunities for a new service.  This included consultation on service areas such as location, delivery in the community, opening times and use of technology.  A summary of the findings can be viewed alongside this advert or available at the link below.

We are currently in phase two of the consultation. We are consulting on a proposed model for sexual health services and would welcome your views as a potential provider of sexual health services in Wigan. More detailed information can be found here: 

https://www.wigan.gov.uk/Council/Consultations/Current/Sexual-health-review.aspx 

In addition, we will be using this event as an opportunity to make providers aware of the forthcoming procurement process for sexual health services in Wigan, and enable providers to raise any questions they may have of Commissioners. Providers attending the event will also be supported to identify opportunities for collaborative delivery of services where this may be appropriate.

This event also provides an opportunity for potential providers to work with stakeholders in the Borough to discuss some specific aspects of the proposed model, including the offer in relation to; Primary Care, Schools, Digital and Vulnerable Groups. 

Please complete the form below if you would like to attend the sexual health stakeholder provider event.  Forms must be returned no later than Friday 28th April.  Restrictions to 2 persons per provider may be applied if over subscribed.",,planning,CPV,85100000,"Health services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"North West","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/YMAF58aB,"Wigan Council","Wigan Council",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/YMAF58aB,"Wigan Life Centre (South), College Avenue",Wigan,"WN1 1NJ",England,"Anthony Baker",Anthony.Baker@wigan.gov.uk,"01942 828643",http://www.wigan.gov.uk,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/YMAF58aB,"Wigan Council",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Additional information: 
We have introduced a new electronic tendering system called CSW-JETS (Coventry, Solihull and Warwickshire's Joint E-Tendering System). In order for you to do business with us in the future you must register on the system by following the link below and then clicking the 'register here' button. 

www.csw-jets.co.uk

CSW-JETS is the new sub-regional e-tendering portal run by In-tend.  Since February 2010, Coventry, Solihull, Warwickshire, Nuneaton & Bedworth and Rugby Councils have been working together as a shared procurement service. Along with Solihull Community Housing, we have joined together to bring you a collaborative E-Tendering portal. 

CSW-JETS enables us to advertise our opportunities across all authorities through the same system. This means that there is a single point of contact for procurement in the sub-region so you only have to register once to receive notifications for all authorities. Registering on the portal will make it easier for local suppliers to find, respond to and be alerted to tender opportunities. 

Registration is free, and takes just a few minutes. When complete, you will be able to express interest in any of the Councils'/Authorities' opportunities when they are made available.

It is particularly important to understand the host factors that influence these viral mutation and adaptation events. This studentship project aims to identify porcine host correlates of infection at the gene expression level. There are several likely candidate genes, mostly from the interferon immune response pathway. However, in some cases, it is unknown whether genes are relevant in the porcine host even though they have been demonstrated to be important during influenza virus infection of other host species or models (humans, mice and others).  The main aim of this work will therefore be to establish new protocols or apply existing methods to verify the choice of target genes and test them on in vitro models and recently archived in vivo materials.

The London Borough of Merton Public Health is looking to engage an organisation, agency or consultant to undertake a 12 month formative evaluation of a Social Prescribing pilot programme. 

London Borough of Merton has embarked on an exciting pilot social prescribing programme in order to explore this approach as part of the primary care transformation underway in the borough. Social prescribing is a way of linking patients in primary care with sources of support within the community. The initiative expands the options available in consultations, creating a coordinated way for primary care services to refer patients with social, emotional and/or practical needs to a variety of local non-clinical services such as leisure, social activities, education, welfare, housing and employment.

      The Houses of Parliament is looking to award a new contract on behalf of the House of Lords Catering & Retail Service and the House Commons Catering Service for a Bicameral Stock Control & Purchasing System. This is to meet the corporate objective of both Houses of Parliament for providing value for money in the delivery of their catering services, through effective and efficient inventory management. Each House is a legal entity in its own right and outlets are owned by one or the other House, not jointly.
      
      Revenue for both House of Commons' and House of Lords' operations is forecast to be over ?13 million in the financial year 2016/17, with total annual covers/transactions estimated at over 1.5 million. In total, the two organisations employ around 400 staff. The stock control and purchasing system will be expected to serve the operational requirements of over 30 venues within five separate sites across the Parliamentary Estate, including the Palace of Westminster.
      
      There is some commonality between the catering ICT systems currently in use in both houses. In the case of Electronic Point of Sale (EPOS) this is Micros 3700 RES 5.4 and Artifax Event 4.2.0.21 for Banqueting and Events Management.
      
      There is currently no common stock management and purchasing system, and the Houses of Parliament is therefore seeking a solution that serves the catering departments in both Houses. Any solution should provide integration with the current EPOS and financial systems.
      
      Currently the catering department in the House of Commons uses Check SCM 3.5 as a Stock Management tool for stock control and purchasing.  The House of Lords catering department does not have any Stock Management system for managing food and all processes are manual using spreadsheets. Beverages and souvenirs are managed using Micros Material control.
      
      o Each House has its own finance system (Agresso) using different cost centre and General Ledger code structures. 
      o We are seeking a solution that can integrate with the existing EPOS and Events Management systems as well as interfacing with each houses finance system. 
      o We are seeking a system that will support both catering departments. In view of the above arrangements, the Houses of Parliament is flexible regarding your proposal; whether this is through two instances of the same system with the ability to be merged at a later stage, or one system to be used by both organisations. 
      
      The Authority is seeking a commercial 'off-the shelf' (COTS) solution; a bespoke solution would not meet the Houses of Parliament's ICT strategic goals. Any added development required to meet the requirements in the ITT should be offered as part of the standard produ...

Additional information: The Houses of Parliament wish to give notice of a potential contract opportunity on behalf of their respective Catering Departments for a Bicameral Stock Control & Purchasing System. This is to meet the corporate objective of both Houses (Commons and Lords) for providing value for money in the delivery of their catering services through effective and efficient inventory management. Each House is a separate entity in its own right and outlets are owned by one or the other House, not jointly.
