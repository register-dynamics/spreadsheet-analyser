Stubbin Wood School Primary and Secondary departments are on a co-located site with Shirebrook Academy. Stubbin Wood is an Area Special School for both boys and girls from 2 -19 years of age.

The Schools currently share the catering facilities, with the meals for Stubbin Wood School Primary pupils being prepared in the main facility in Shirebrook Academy and transported via a short, interconnecting corridor, to the dining area within Stubbin Wood School where it is served 'family service' style. Stubbin Wood School Secondary and 6th Form pupils attend the first sitting in the main dining area within Shirebrook Academy, where they gain valuable life skills in the self-serve facility.

The tender project is seeking to appoint a Contractor whose initiative and innovation will be welcomed for the provision of services within the existing facilities for the 792 students on roll at Shirebrook Academy and the 180 teaching and support staff, and the current 120 students on roll at Stubbin Wood School and the 65 teaching and support staff, with a focus on exciting new food concepts to satisfy a wide range of pupil tastes and dietary requirements. The Schools would wish the successful contractor to review the current range of services offered and make recommendations accordingly.

The contract being tendered is for three years in duration from April 2017 and will operate as a Guaranteed Performance Contract, with the successful Contractor offering the Schools a guaranteed cost per annum for the provision of catering services. Sovereignty of the meal tariff is to remain with the Schools for the duration of this contract.

Each School year is based on a calendar of 195 days. Five days are to be used for staff professional development which means that Schools will be open to receive students for the legal minimum of 190 days.

The contract offered covers the scope for the provision of all catering services within the Schools, which currently includes breakfast, morning break and lunch and all hospitality and free issue requirements. Free School Meals and hospitality will be charged based on consumption and at net food cost.

Whilst the Schools prioritise value for money as a key objective of the competitive tender process, the Governing Body is not obliged to accept the lowest price.

In recent years the Council has removed the existing brick piers & gates to the main entrance and constructed new feature piers and ornamental railings.  The remaining brick wall, piers and railings have deteriorated through poor design, choice of materials and lack of maintenance. This is particularly the case with the remaining art deco rails and gates which are beyond repair.  

The purpose of this Project is to carry out essential repairs to the existing original wall and provide new ornamental railings. The second pair of gates & pedestrian gate will be removed, the piers demolished and the gap to wall infilled.

The commissioning organisations are North and West Reading, Newbury and District, South Reading and Wokingham CCGs. 
The CCGs work together on four key areas/programmes: Urgent Care, Long Term Conditions, Planned Care and Joint Commissioning, The programmes are led by: 

•	Planned Care, Newbury & District CCG
•	Urgent Care, North and West Reading CCG
•	Long Term Conditions, South Reading CCG
•	Joint Commissioning, Wokingham

The group has implemented a robust executive management structure across all four CCGs.

MSK Context 
MSK conditions are the largest single contributor to years of life lost to disability after the age of 30 years in the UK.  Nationally 1 in 5 people consult their GP each year for a musculoskeletal condition. Over the course of the last year Berkshire West have been examining the provision for MSK services and as a part of that ""discovery"" have had a number of discussions and events engaging with patients, public and clinicians to help identify and determine the key issues within the current service as well as to start to collect, collate and form ideas that help us to understand what a really first class new service for patients might look like. 

As an overarching strategy for MSK the CCGs' aim is to deliver a fully integrated pathway for MSK. 

Next Steps 

Before the commissioners determine and or formalise the next steps for the evolution of MSK in Berkshire West we would very much like to speak directly with any and all MSK service providers both locally and across the UK in a workshop engagement setting to be held on the 15th of June. The event is planned for a 2 hour duration and will start at 4.30pm through 6.30pm. Please RSVP your attendance to Zoe.sugrue@nhs.net and further details will be provided.

We look forward to meeting with you, discussing and engaging on all things MSK.",,planning,CPV,85100000,"Health services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"South East","United Kingdom",,"South West","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/FDEK7nf7,"NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT","NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/FDEK7nf7,"57-59 Bath Road",Reading,"RG30 2BA",England,"Zoe Sugrue",Zoe.sugrue@nhs.net,,,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/FDEK7nf7,"NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to achieve the James Paget University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust's ('the Trust') ambitious site development and estates strategy, the Trust is seeking a partner (The Strategic Estates Partner ('the SEP')) to assist with the provision of an intelligent estates strategy function to include estates rationalisation, capital programme planning, financing, procurement and construction project management.  This may include the provision of hard and soft Facilities Management (FM).

It is envisaged that these services may be provided to the Trust through the establishment of a joint venture body (""JV"") between the Trust and the SEP to deliver the schemes. However the Trust remains open to the market as to innovative structures or solutions.

Please see attached for further details of services which may be in scope.

Additional information: Expressions of interest accompanied by the completed questionnaire are to be submitted to Julie Averies at julie.averies@jpaget.nhs.uk by Wednesday 14th June 2017.
Depending on the level of interest, all relevant suppliers will be invited to attend a soft market assessment event (date to be confirmed). 

The Trust is aiming to seek an early market assessment of the potential options and opportunities available in order to deliver its ambitious site development and estates strategy.

Please Note:

 The in-service support packages available are: RFA WAVE KNIGHT, RFA WAVE RULER, RFA FORT AUSTIN, RFA FORT ROSALIE, RFA FORT VICTORIA (Lot 1) - Estimated value £320M over ten (10) year contract duration; RFA LYME BAY, RFA MOUNTS BAY, RFA CARDIGAN BAY, RFA ARGUS, HMS SCOTT (Lot 2) - Estimated value £275M over ten (10) year contract duration; and / or RFA TIDESPRING, RFA TIDERACE , RFA TIDESURGE, RFA TIDEFORCE (Lot 3) - Estimated value £345M over ten (10) year contract duration, which will include but not be limited to: worldwide engineering support; rectification of Operational Defects; and the planning, management and implementation of maintenance periods. Maintenance periods may include, but not be limited to: Refit Periods; Docking Periods; Contractor Support Periods; Annual Certification Periods; and Assisted Maintenance Periods.
- The successful bidder will also be required to provide design, planning, implementation and technical services for the various update, upgrade and / or modification packages along with the global supply and transport of spares.

A joint team (the Authority and the successful bidder) will be co-located at the successful bidder's premises and work collaboratively with other CSS support. It is envisioned that there will be one (1) joint support team per Lot.

The contract will be for ten (10) years, with a value for money exercise commencing at the three and a half (3.5) year point. The Authority will have the option, at its sole discretion, to break the contract at the five (5) year point if it believes value for money is not being achieved.
Years one (1) to five (5) will be firm price i.e. not subject to variation, and years six (6) to ten (10) will be fixed price, subject to the price index / indices stated in the contract. The justification for the proposed framework duration is that RFA and OSV vessels require a refit period every five (5) years, and a ten (10) year framework will allow for two (2) refit periods within one contractual agreement which will provide benefits to both the successful bidder and Authority through learning for experience. Planning a refit period requires eighteen (18) months, and a seven (7) year contract period would risk interruption to the planning or delivery of a second refit period. Certification is required at a docking every five (5) years so a ten (10) year framework would afford full certification twice preventing the risk of uncertified and therefore unusable vessels in the fleet. This is therefore deemed as exceptional circumstances.

No work whatsoever is guaranteed under any resulting framework agreement or contract and there is no guarantee that any framework agreement or contract will be put in place in relation to this notice. No compensation etc. will be paid if a tender or resulting framework agreement is withdrawn for any reason.

Core Podiatry is defined as 'the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of common foot pathologies associated with the toenails, soft tissues and the musculoskeletal system with the purpose of sustaining or improving foot health' (Farndon, 2006). The service will focus on the needs of those individuals with low and medium levels of foot care needs, with potential providers referring on to specialised podiatry and extended scope podiatry as required and further signposting to non-podiatric services where clinically appropriate, e.g. smoking cessation or weight management services

Additional information: 
The objectives of the service will be to provide: • Assessment and intervention for those patients with painful foot conditions where this has reduced mobility and independence, • A surgical option for nail pathologies, • Management of foot pain associated with foot function and/or structural abnormalities for common foot and ankle conditions, • Footwear advice and orthotics as part of personalised care plans • Foot health education information and public health information including signposting to services • Equitable access for patients across the geographical region of Derbyshire Integral to the above is: • Provision of falls prevention advice (following local falls prevention pathway and guidance into specialist services where appropriate) and health education. • Adults and children with a podiatric need including iatrogenic conditions without comorbidity, i.e. foot conditions that are a result of health care treatment that do not have direct pathology but do have related lesions elsewhere in the foot.",,complete,CPV,85140000,"Miscellaneous health services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"East Midlands","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,1521000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2016-12-09T23:59:59Z,,2017-06-01T00:00:00+01:00,2020-05-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,1,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-58254,"Arden & GEM CSU","Arden & GEM CSU",,,"Cardinal Square, 10 Nottingham Road,",Derby,"DE1 3QT",England,"Lisa  Innes",Lisa.Innes@ardengemcsu.nhs.uk,"+44 1332888014",https://ardengemcsu.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html,buyer,GB-CFS-58255,"Derbyshire Community Healthcare Services NHS Foundation Trust","Derbyshire Community Healthcare Services NHS Foundation Trust","Newholme Hospital, Baslow Road, Bakewell, Derbyshire, DE45 1AD",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-58254,"Arden & GEM CSU",ocds-b5fd17-6ffccb16-071f-4a67-8b0a-bef37a9f939b-1,active,2017-05-17T00:00:00+01:00,2017-06-01T11:33:04+01:00,1520725,GBP,GB-CFS-58255,"Derbyshire Community Healthcare Services NHS Foundation Trust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-06-01T00:00:00+01:00,2020-05-31T23:59:59+01:00,,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/4eda384c-1ec7-498b-918c-7e5f0b4592f3,2017-06-01T11:33:04+01:00,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"E-Tendering Portal",https://ardengemcsu.bravosolution.co.uk,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lot 1: Housing Needs Study
Tunbridge Wells Borough Council is seeking to commission a Housing Needs Study (""HNS"") with a view to developing a more detailed and robust evidence base to support its new Housing and Planning policies and strategies. In commissioning the study, it will be better placed to determine local housing priorities and effectively target limited resources in the coming years.

The report will provide robust evidence to support the planning policies being developed within the emerging Local Plan and for planning/enforcement applications and appeals. The primary purpose of the  gypsy and travelling showpeople pitch assessment  (GTAA) report is to conclude on a reasoned and reasonable requirement for gypsy and traveller pitches and for travelling showpeople plots, both public and private, for the Local Plan period 2013- 2033.
