In the first instance the measurement will provide information about how a solid is wetted by a particular liquid and secondly, enable material interactions to be optimised by understanding their fundamental hydrogen bonding, dispersion and polar forces present in dispersion processes.   Furthermore, the use of iGC (Inverse Gas Chromatography) can help to understand diffusion kinetics and solubility parameters, properties that affect the performance and processing of many materials.  The ability to understand these properties will greatly enhance the capability of the National Formulation Centre.
Inverse gas chromatography is a physical characterization technique that is used in the analysis of the surfaces of solids. Traditional GC is an analytical technique.
Inverse gas chromatography or IGC is a highly sensitive and versatile gas phase technique developed over 40 years ago to study the surface and bulk properties of particulate and fibrous materials. In IGC the roles of the stationary (solid) and mobile (gas or vapor) phases are inverted from traditional analytical gas chromatography (GC). In GC, a standard column is used to separate and characterize several gases and/or vapors. In IGC, a single gas or vapor (probe molecule) is injected into a column packed with the solid sample under investigation. Instead of an analytical technique, IGC is considered a materials characterization technique",2016-02-12T17:44:48Z,active,CPV,73111000,"Research laboratory services",CPV,51430000,"Installation services of laboratory equipment",CPV,38434000,Analysers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"North East","United Kingdom",,,,,,,70000,GBP,85000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2016-02-29T23:59:59Z,,2016-03-31T00:00:00+01:00,2016-05-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,,goods,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/269b8836-ce6f-4423-8d5f-a9ef8de66fdf,2016-02-12T17:44:48Z,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"NOTE: To register your interest in this notice and obtain any additional information please visit the myTenders Web Site at the link provided.",http://www.mytenders.org/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=FEB120555,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/au8q6EUc,"CENTRE FOR PROCESS INNOVATION LIMITED","CENTRE FOR PROCESS INNOVATION LIMITED",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/au8q6EUc,"Thomas Wright Way, NETPark",Sedgefield,"TS21 3FG",England,"Steven Thomas",e-tendering@uk-cpi.com,"+44 1642455340",http://www.uk-cpi.com/tender,buyer,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/au8q6EUc,"CENTRE FOR PROCESS INNOVATION LIMITED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The nature of the transient plane heaters allows the TPS system to determine thermal behaviours in anisotropic materials such as graphene.

The Council requires the provision of Containers to enable the storage of approved waste within depots and Waste Transfer Stations, the collection and transport of these approved wastes to a licensed Treatment and Disposal Facility for disposal. Approved wastes include; Offensive Waste, Infectious Waste, Sharps Waste, Cytotoxic and Cytostatic Medicines, Medicinal Waste, Amalgam Waste and Small Animal Remains.

The purpose of the Councils pre-procurement market engagement process is to allow and enable potentially interested organisations with appropriate expertise and relevant experience to:

Engage with the Hertfordshire County Council to enable the Council to understand how best to construct the pricing in a meaningful way within a future procurement. 

The Council will consider the feedback and responses received to help inform the Councils options and further decision making. For the avoidance of doubt, this stage of the project is not part of a formal procurement process and the Council is not committing, at this stage, to carrying out such a process. 

Participation or non-participation in the pre-procurement market engagement process shall not prevent any supplier participating in a potential future procurement, nor is it intended that any information supplied as part of the pre-procurement process shall place any supplier at an advantage in a potential procurement process. 

Participation in the pre-procurement market engagement procurement process will be at each suppliers own cost. No expense in responding to this process will be reimbursed by the Council. 
The Council will not enter into a contract based solely on the responses to this PIN and no information contained in the documents or in any communication made between the Council and any contractor in connection with its pre-procurement market engagement shall be relied upon as constituting a contract, agreement or representation that any contract shall be awarded.

This pre-procurement market engagement process will comprise:

Submission of the Supplier Questionnaire (please see Appendix A of the pre-procurement market engagement documentation) following the instructions detailed in Section VI.2 below. Supplier Questionnaires must be received by 12.00 Noon on Thursday 25 February 2016

Completing the Supplier Questionnaire
Any supporting documents should be cross-referenced to the relevant question. If the Council requires further information concerning your response, your organisation will be contacted.

Any extension to the contract will be at the sole discretion of the Council. 

The Supplier will deliver travel behaviour change to young people during the 16/17 financial year through a programme of school engagement.

The Council is not prescriptive on the approach to programme design and methodology; however it is anticipated that programme content will include a team of suitably skilled and experienced personnel to provide travel advice, training, events and incentives tailored to the unique geography and circumstance of the Islands 49 schools. The programme will focus on inspiring young people to travel to and from school more sustainably, building on existing school travel plans already prepared and adopted by the schools.

The redesign of Bournemouth?s Mental Health Supported Housing services aims to ensure that people who require high support housing have access to it when they need it and that it is the type of quality that will enable them to live as independently as possible in the least restrictive setting.

There is currently an over-supply of long term accommodation, an under supply of high level support accommodation and an under supply of step down accommodation.  The current pathway no longer matches demand and following review of the services, the new Pathway will be for High Level Support for people with low level independence who may be coming from a hospital situation with a mental health diagnosis, or have a high level of mental health needs.  The High level support will provide to one to one support.  The Medium/Low level Support shall be delivered on a Floating Support basis, to enable Service Users to increase their independence while living in their own homes or step down accommodation.  

The new Pathway will start at High level support and will move Service Users on to Medium/Low level Floating Support in their own homes or step down accommodation.  Occasionally Service Users may revert back through the Pathway from Medium/Low level Floating Support to High level support. 

The Service Provider will need to provide property comprising a total of 20 units.  There is flexibility in how the units are made up.  For example, you may have two properties with 7 units in each and one property with 6 units.

Working as part of the overall Camden and Islington Adult Healthy Lifestyles programme for lot 1 we are seeking a provider who can deliver NHS Health Checks and Community Outreach both as part of the overall lifestyle programme.
NHS Health Checks is a nationally mandated public health programme that aims to keep people well for longer. It is a risk assessment and management programme that aims to prevent or delay the onset of major non-communicable disease including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and kidney disease through earlier awareness, assessment, and management of risk factors and conditions.  These assessments are targeted at those aged 40 to 74 years with no diagnosed long term conditions. This service will deliver NHS Health Checks in the community alongside those delivered in General Practice. 
In Camden and Islington we recognise that the burden of ill health is such that our populations would benefit from lifestyle interventions that stretch beyond the national eligibility criteria and remit of the NHS Health Checks. 
The immediate aim of both NHS Health Checks and Lifestyle Checks is to identify risk factors; deliver healthy living messages; and motivate behaviour change through relevant behaviour change techniques and onward referral to GPs and the Lifestyle Hub. The approach to Lifestyle Checks has been determined locally but is based on the best practice of the lifestyle elements of the NHS Health Check.

The Department for Education's (DfE) vision is for a highly educated society in which opportunity is more equal for children and young people, no matter what their background or family circumstances. Some areas of the country and some types of school face particular difficulties in recruiting headteachers. Evidence suggests that failure to recruit a permanent, high quality headteacher can lead to performance dips for schools.

The DfE has funded a High Potential Senior Leaders (HPSL) programme since 2006. The programme is designed to raise levels of pupil achievement in England’s challenging schools. It is targeted at attracting and developing aspiring and current high-potential senior leaders from all types of schools who have the talent and commitment to become headteachers of challenging schools within an accelerated timeframe.

The new contract:

The National College for Teaching and Leadership (NCTL), an executive agency of the DfE, is seeking one national provider (or consortium) to deliver the High Potential Senior Leaders (HPSL) programme to two existing cohorts.

1.	The current HPSL contract with Future Leaders Trust (FLT) ends on 31 August 2016 and delivery would be required from September 2016 to cover the training requirements for two existing cohorts. This will involve the delivery of Year 3 to c101 participants, who will complete in 2017, and the delivery of Years 2 and 3 to c125 participants who will complete in 2018.

2.	The anticipated maximum whole life contract cost will be within the estimated range of £2m and £3m GBP (inclusive of all expenses and exclusive of VAT). VAT (where applicable) will be at the GB prevailing rate. Please note that contract requirements will be subject to available financial resources, supplier performance and flexibility to meet changing demands.

3.	Duration in months: a maximum of 30 months (up to and inclusive of September 2018) from the award of the contract. Subject to agreement from DfE Ministers, this will include an initial set up phase during April-July 2016, ready for commencement of programme delivery to existing participants from August 2016, and a close down phase from August to September 2018.

The anticipated maximum whole life contract cost will be within the estimated range of £2m and £3m GBP (inclusive of all expenses and exclusive of VAT). VAT (where applicable) will be at the GB prevailing rate. Please note that contract requirements will be subject to available financial resources, supplier performance and flexibility to meet changing demands.

Additional information: If the potential supplier bidding for the requirement is part of a consortium joint venture or SPV, NCTL  will require full details of the consortium joint venture or SPV.

Potential suppliers should provide details of the actual or proposed percentage shareholding of the constituent members within the consortium in a separate attachment. If a consortium is not proposing to form a corporate entity, full details of alternative proposed arrangements should be provided in the attachment. Please note that NCTL reserves the right to require a successful consortium to form a single legal entity.

NCTL recognises that arrangements in relation to consortia may (within limits) be subject to future change. Potential consortia should therefore respond in the light of the arrangements as currently envisaged. Potential consortia are reminded that any future proposed change in relation to consortia must be notified to the NCTL so that it can make a further assessment by applying the selection criteria to the new information provided.
If an SPV is formed by a single organisation to separate liabilities from the parent company then NCTL would require a parent company guarantee.

In 2012 Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead launched a Shared Live Scheme for people with learning disabilities.  The Scheme now supports six full time placements and two regular short breaks, with a number of other people with learning disabilities accessing short breaks on ad hoc basis.
The Borough has been unsuccessful in recruiting carers in the traditional provider model.  RBWM wish to develop a larger local carer base to enable us to grow our Shared Lives Scheme to offer a wider range of services that will include:
•	Long term care/support
•	Short term care and respite
•	Day Care/Support
•	Outreach and befriending
•	A carers break scheme for Shared Lives carers
The Borough would now like to carry out market research on a social investment shared lives model.  The provider must secure social investment to support the expanding of the Shared Lives Scheme in the Borough.  This investment will be used by the provider to operate the scheme to recruit and train staff and carers to substantial grow the Shared Lives Scheme and ultimately successful establish new placements. 
How to Express an Interest
If you are an experienced Shared Lives Scheme provider that can provide the social investment model please express your interest to RBWM providing us with the following organisational and service information: 
1)	How can you deliver the Social investment service model?
2)	Detail the success you have had in securing funding and the typical funding sources secured.
3)	Describe your experience in developing and growing a successful Shared Lives Scheme if ideally with similar demography.
4)	Detail a cost model of a typical social investment shared lives scheme of this size

At the most basic level, identity management involves defining what users can do on the network with specific devices and under what circumstances. At UCA there is a wide range of requirements that need to be managed and identity management will enhance security by providing a single definition point.

The program aims to implement identity in achievable, sequenced projects to achieve its goals. 

The goals of the project will be:

•	To rationalise user access to systems and provide one single login.
•	To improve security by providing a single gate into the systems
•	To retire systems and procedures that create vulnerabilities when accessing the network
•	To utilize office 365 which also provides user storage. This will reduce the demand for space on the network and reduce the backup requirement

The date has been revised to the day before.Description: Buildings of particular historical or architectural interest. Refurbishment work. South Cambridgeshire District Council is looking for a suitably qualified and experienced contractor to provide specialist remedial repairs to 13 non traditional houses in SCDC’s stock.

These 13 non traditional houses are Airey construction, comprising two differing 3 bed semi-detached archetypes; these post-war prefabricated concrete structures consist of precast concrete storey-height columns of steel tube reinforced concrete columns to which thin concrete cladding panels are fastened with copper wire.

The repairs that are envisaged to the steel tube reinforced concrete columns are to surface treat, treat & repair, remove and provide new base supports, in preparation to receive External Wall Insulation (EWI) to extend the lifetime of these properties for a minimum of 25 years. This contract shall involve the use of modern repair methods using specialist treatments and also modern building materials. 

Whilst the materials and techniques will be modern, this is not a straightforward remedial construction contract, due to the non traditional design and the age of the buildings. Therefore this assignment would suit a contractor used to providing remedial repairs to non traditional buildings, historical buildings, unusual buildings or buildings that comprise of precast concrete. 

Two of the properties are currently unoccupied (Void) and it is expected that these two houses will act as the sample properties for the envisaged repairs before rolling the repairs out to the occupied properties.
