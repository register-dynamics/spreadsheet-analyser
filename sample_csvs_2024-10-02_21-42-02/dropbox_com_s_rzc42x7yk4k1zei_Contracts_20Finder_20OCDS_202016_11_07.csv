Title 
 
Genetic Screening For Development Of Trees With Tolerance to Ash Dieback 


Description
 
Since its discovery in 2012, ash dieback (ADB) has continued to spread throughout the UK ash population. If the UK proves similar to mainland Europe, we can expect to lose many of our ash trees over the next decade. If dying trees are to be replaced with less susceptible genotypes before the losses to industry and the ecosystem are irreversible, new tools will need to be developed. The aims of this project are to provide an Associative Transcriptomics platform to facilitate selective breeding in ash and to use this platform to develop genetic markers linked to tolerance to ADB.",,complete,CPV,73200000,"Research and development consultancy services",CPV,77100000,"Agricultural services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"British Oversea Territories",,"Channel Islands",,Europe,,"Isle of Man",,"Rest of the World",,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,100204,GBP,,,2016-10-01T23:59:59+01:00,2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00,2017-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-38169,"Defra Network eTendering Portal","Defra Network eTendering Portal",,,Defra,London,"SW1P 3JR",England,,Network.Procurement@defra.gsi.gov.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-39930,"University of York","University of York","Heslington, York",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-38169,"Defra Network eTendering Portal",ocds-b5fd17-6b60802d-adca-11e6-9901-0019b9f3037b-1,active,2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00,2016-11-07T17:52:32Z,100204,GBP,GB-CFS-39930,"University of York",,,2016-10-01T00:00:00+01:00,2017-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/77ded5a8-3c02-4fb6-99a3-bcf53fbc6673,2016-11-07T17:52:32Z,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This project will assess the migration of adult sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus in the tidal Yorkshire Ouse. By determining when sea lamprey migrate through the tidal Ouse and which environmental factors may be impacting their migration we can gain a better understanding of these species and the potential pressures that they face. This study should determine how many sea lampreys are migrating through the catchment, how far they migrate and temporality of the migration. 

 The aim of this study is to add to the evidence gained in 2015 and increase our understanding of potential impacts of the annual DO sag on sea lamprey migration through the Humber Estuary. We hope to investigate whether sea lamprey migration occurs at the same time as the DO sag and if these two activities occur at the same time, is the DO sag causing a barrier to sea lamprey migration. 

 This study will only monitor the timing and movements of sea lamprey. Another study will be carried our concurrently by the Environment Agency (EA) who will monitor the DO levels. 

 The data collected from this study will be compared to and analysed against the DO data collected by the EA which should give us an indication of the impact of the DO sag on sea lamprey migration. This data will also be used to compare with the results and outputs from the study carried out in 2015.",,complete,CPV,73112000,"Marine research services",CPV,98360000,"Marine services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"Yorkshire and the Humber","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20343,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2016-09-16T23:59:59+01:00,2016-11-01T00:00:00Z,2017-10-31T23:59:59Z,1,1,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-38197,"Defra Network eTendering Portal","Defra Network eTendering Portal",,,"Natural England",Peterborough,"PE1 1NG",England,,Supplier.enquiries@naturalengland.org.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-39929,"Paragon Ecology","Paragon Ecology","6 East Lane, Stanhope, Bishop Auckland, Durham",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-38197,"Defra Network eTendering Portal",ocds-b5fd17-6b5e72df-adca-11e6-9901-0019b9f3037b-1,active,2016-09-23T00:00:00+01:00,2016-11-07T17:45:45Z,20343,GBP,GB-CFS-39929,"Paragon Ecology",,,2016-11-01T00:00:00Z,2017-10-31T23:59:59Z,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/cb727e55-6b17-4e98-84b3-0e875d89f942,2016-11-07T17:45:45Z,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The programme is funded by the European Union’s European Regional Development Framework programme (ERDF) and runs from 1 March 2016 to 1 February 2019.  The project will provide a consistent, accessible business support programme across the South East Local Enterprise Partnership (SELEP) area to help small-to-medium sized businesses (SMEs) to optimise the use of resources and adopt low carbon solutions to improve business resilience, profitability and competitiveness, and at the same time contributing to the protection of the environment.

            2)   companies in the environmental and low carbon sectors wishing to grow and innovate    
                  (supply side). 

ESCC is responsible for delivering targets which include:

            1)   120 energy audits;
            2)   120 energy efficiency grants.

Short Breaks allow a child to spend time apart from their parent/carer, take part in activities they like, form and develop friendships and become more confident and independent. Short Breaks allow the child’s family to have a break from the demands of caring, to relax and recharge their batteries, to spend time with each other and their other children and to reduce family stress.
There is no guarantee of business under this framework.  As a guide, the Council’s potential spend is up to £1.7 million per annum. However this does not represent a commitment to purchase the value stated, either as a minimum or a maximum, under the framework. Orders placed under the framework will be awarded on an individual basis.

The demand on the service is increasing. as is the throughput and volume of customers to the service counter, with a significant increase in the recruiting of students expected over the forthcoming years; this is putting further stress and strain on the current members of staff.

There is increasing pressure from the faculties (students and staff) to move towards an electronic reservation service, where students and staff are able to choose their equipment ahead of time and be in control of the reservation, allocating an allotted time for pickup and return.

The purpose of the Requirements Specification is to provide a detailed description of the requirements for the new AV Loans Self-Service Solution.

These areas will include offices, and some rooms and corridors subject to high levels of footfall. The patterns of these woven carpets must harmonise with and be compatible with the existing floorcoverings for consistency during installation.  Whilst the main focus of this tender is the provision of a bulk orders of 80% wool, 20% nylon woven carpets, it has been decided that the woven carpet range should also include a quantity of synthetic woven floorcoverings (60% to 100% nylon) to maximise our ability to carry out pest control measures.

To ensure value for money, the quality required should ensure that the products remain in operational use beyond any minimum warranty period, regardless of works scheduled during their natural lifecycle; the ability to lift and store the material is essential.  The estimated value of the framework includes the bulk purchase and delivery of woven carpets over the period of the framework, and their installation.

A proportion of funding will be accredited learning and will be focused on unemployed individuals within the Borough who are eligible for full funding as outlined in the service specification. Commissioned provision will be aimed at entry level to level 2.  This learning will be targeted at meeting local wellbeing and employment priorities in a number of subject areas.
