Ofqual regulates GCSEs, AS and A levels in England within the context of government policy. A programme to reform and redevelop these qualifications has been under way since 2013. Exam boards are producing new subject specifications which we are reviewing to make sure they are of the right standard. The changes being made to GCSEs will mean they are more engaging and worthwhile to teach and to study, and that they compare well with similar qualifications internationally. And the changes at A level will ensure they remain a highly respected qualification both domestically and internationally.
Ofqual would like to create a video, or series of videos, with the aim of raising awareness and understanding of aspects of the reforms among key stakeholders. The programme will focus on using the new GCSE grading scale (9 to 1) as a vehicle to drive engagement. The central messages we would like to convey are: that the grading scale is changing from letters to numbers; the reasons for this, i.e. to signal that a reformed, more demanding GCSE has been studied and to better differentiate student performance at the top end (there will be nine grades instead of eight); and, that students who get a grade 4 or above in the first year of awarding would have got a grade C or above on the existing letter scale.",,complete,CPV,79341400,"Advertising campaign services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,"West Midlands","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,60230,GBP,open,,"Open procedure",2016-11-04T23:59:59Z,2016-11-16T00:00:00Z,2017-01-17T23:59:59Z,1,,goods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-12206,"Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual)","Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual)",,,"Spring Place, Coventry Business Park, Herald Avenue",Coventry,"CV5 6UB",England,"Pauline Galliers",Procurement@Ofqual.gov.uk,"+44 2476716830",http://ofqual.gov.uk,buyer,GB-CFS-45236,"Pukka Films","Pukka Films","18 Hatton Place, , London",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-12206,"Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation (Ofqual)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ocds-b5fd17-8ab0bbf4-8f28-4a8b-8d61-e74ccacd4a5c-1,active,2016-11-15T00:00:00Z,2017-01-19T17:45:04Z,60230.5,GBP,GB-CFS-45236,"Pukka Films",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-11-16T00:00:00Z,2017-01-17T23:59:59Z,,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/5c36b1dc-3ac2-438e-9d02-93124ff86425,2017-01-19T17:45:04Z,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"NOTE: To register your interest in this notice and obtain any additional information please visit the myTenders Web Site at the link provided.",http://www.mytenders.org/search/show/search_view.aspx?ID=JAN137332,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On November 17th 2016, the UK Government signed the Paris Climate Agreement, which provides a framework for governments as well as business and investors to keep global warming below 2°C, pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. Furthermore, one of the main aims of the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy is to ensure the UK has a reliable, low cost, and clean energy system, with reducing greenhouse gas emissions being central to this. The UK 2050 Calculator provides a tool to allow users to investigate ways of tackling climate change, and reducing UK greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with the Climate Change Act 2008.
The UK 2050 Calculator was first published in 2011 alongside the Carbon Plan . The calculator was re-released in 2012 to incorporate costs with a 2007 baseline. The calculator has a web-interface, supporting spreadsheet and data. There are 40 ""levers"" of change with a range of options for each one. The calculator is deliberately simple, quick and can keep a record of stakeholders' chosen pathways. The calculator was developed in a very open and transparent way. It went through an extensive call-for-evidence, stakeholder workshops, and was continually updated using stakeholder feedback. It is a very useful tool for assessing the merit of pursuing different low carbon technologies; for example, the original 2050 calculator was used to generate scenarios for the 2011 Carbon Plan. It is also very helpful in stakeholder engagement; for example, the original calculator was used for public engagement at the British Energy Challenge roadshow.
The UK 2050 Calculator hasn't been updated for a number of years, therefore is currently out-of-date. BEIS aims to increase the impact of the tool by aligning its underlying assumptions with other BEIS models, updating the lever and level assumptions, improving its functionality, and extending the timeline so that it operates within to 2100. The updated calculator will be used to improve the modelling capability of BEIS and support stakeholder engagement in climate change.

The project provides a first connection between SME businesses and Universities to support businesses to trade online.  It will operate across the South East Midlands, an  area which covers Aylesbury, Banbury, Bedford, Bicester, Daventry, Kettering, Leighton Buzzard, Luton, Milton Keynes and Northampton.
The objective is to provide 150 businesses across the geography with a short, expert intervention looking at how a business might use online trade as a way to access new markets or offer new products or improve productivity.  A second element of the project is the grant element whereby a business may apply for a grant of between £1-15,000 at a 30% intervention rate to deliver the plan laid out in stage 1.  Businesses will be supported to deliver new to market and new to business products and services.  Additionally 55 new businesses will be helped to start up from scratch.
The University of Bedfordshire is the Accountable body and is responsible for the delivery of outputs, project management and financial accounting and compliance with ERDF regulations.  Any contract resulting from this enquiry is issued under the University's terms and conditions including payment terms.
System requirements
Overall
The University needs to have a system in place to track and manage the delivery of the project.  This brief is to procure this system.  The purpose of the system is to automate as much of the processes as possible, providing an auditable, low-carbon method of managing approximately 300 small-data-volume users.  It is unlikely that the system would have to cope with more than 15 concurrent users.
The system will be a web based application with role-based restricted access to many areas of the site.  Our preference is for an open-source content management system such as Drupal or Wordpress operating through a cloud hosted environment.  This must be compliant with CESG Cloud principles found here: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/implementing-the-cloud-security-principles/implementing-the-cloud-security-principles

Originally branded as 'Business Lifebelt', the project aimed to provide support to businesses in the wake of the global financial crisis and UK recession that followed from it. The branding change to 'Ride the Wave' came amidst more optimism in the economy, and supported both pre-start and existing businesses in fulfilling their growth ambitions. Ride the Wave was specifically targeted at addressing gaps in publically-funded business support. The most recent Ride the Wave 5 project ran May 2016 to September 2016, and offered an intensive range of opportunities to help sustain and grow our local economy. There were workshops for people with a business idea they wanted to develop and for start-up businesses in their early years of trading.  There were also workshops for established businesses, which offered help in overcoming barriers to growth.  Some businesses also took the opportunity to have a follow-up session with a business mentor.  169 businesses participated in the programme; the workshops and activities secured a 100% satisfaction rating from participants. 
      The national Business Link Service has been replaced by Regional Growth Hubs; in the case of Brighton & Hove the growth hub is the Coast to Capital Business Navigator which provides a signposting service for business seeking support. The successful tenderer will be expected to liaise with the Business Navigator as a potential source of recruits to the project. The commissioning of Ride the Wave 6 comes at a time when there is greater economic uncertainty about the impact of leaving the European Union.  This uncertainty is already having an impact on the value of sterling and investment decisions and many businesses are now considering how they can prepare themselves for the opportunities being created within a post-Brexit economy. The aim of Ride the Wave 6 is to provide workshops that help to support local business sustainability, build business resilience, give them the businesses the skills / confidence to grow, increase gross value added and create jobs. Bidders will need to demonstrate that they understand the particular issues that local businesses are challenged with, (which may be different for different sectors), and deliver a programme of support to compliment and augment existing business support services and not duplicate or confuse what is already a very complex business support landscape. The Ride the Wave individual workshops will take a sector-specific or thematic approach and the programme will need to be developed in consultation with the business community to ensure the training is tailored, practical and relevant. Ride the Wave 6 will need to encourage take up of business support amongst non-networked businesses, BME and women owned businesses by targeting and working with these cohorts, such as The Mumpreneurs Networking Club etc.  The BME business community is s...

HS2 currently have an indicative timetable for future HS2 services and an initial headcount based on HS2 assumptions surrounding job roles and likely locations.To obtain a more realistic view on the anticipated numbers of staff and their place of employment, the timetable data and rolling stock circulation and utilisation plan needs to be translated into a set of working diagrams for each job role for the phase 2a and phase 2b train service specification as defined in the 'Statement of Requirements'. To successfully carry out this task, HS2 require a resource that has the appropriate software available to them (e.g. Tracsis TrainTracs software) that can read and interpret data supplied by ATTUNE software which will be in either a Cif, SPG or PIF format regarding rolling stock circulation and trained operatives to input the HS2 datasets. They will then need to run a number of scenarios through the system and produce sets of diagrams and a report on the headcount and locations for all operational resources.To submit a proposal in response to this Opportunity Notice, you will need to register with HS2's e-Sourcing Portal; Bravo - https://hs2.bravosolution.co.uk/web/login.html (please see registration instructions attached to this notice). The RFQ response deadline is 12 noon on 3rd February 2017. Please note that all queries should be raised through the secure messaging facility on Bravo (the deadline for queries is 12 noon on 27th January 2017).",2017-01-19T14:02:22Z,active,CPV,73000000,"Research and development services and related consultancy services",CPV,48000000,"Software package and information systems",CPV,72000000,"IT services: consulting, software development, Internet and support",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"British Oversea Territories",,"Channel Islands",,Europe,,"Isle of Man",,"Rest of the World",,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Other - ",2017-02-03T23:59:59Z,2017-02-10T00:00:00Z,2017-02-28T23:59:59Z,1,,services,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/09763a35-b9b5-4990-92da-0a427c6e604a,2017-01-19T14:14:40Z,text/html,en,4,tenderNotice,n/a,https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/c3e37161-8934-4f9b-ba07-a74a7a0bd6ed,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,,,,,,GB-CFS-44541,HS2,HS2,,,"Two Snow Hill, Queensway",Birmingham,"B4 6GA",England,,hannah.cole@hs2.org.uk,,,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-44541,HS2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      Flint Green is owned by Midland Heart Ltd and offers the site for sale, managed service or lease. The Council/CCGs have a preference to continue the service at this venue as it will avoid disruption to the citizens using the facility. The evaluation will be initially based on the use of this site. However if no suitable bid is offered from this site the Council/CCGs will consider alternative sites.

Firstly, much of the existing stock in which RBG accommodates people is not suitable to meet the needs of service users. In addition, there is a lack of capacity to accommodate people in the borough. Adults’ and Older People’s Services’ strength is in the delivery of social care; either directly or through commissioned services. The Directorate’s expertise is not in developing housing solutions. Therefore Royal Greenwich wishes to commission a partner to work with officers to develop and project manage the delivery of a strategy to deliver housing solutions that are of good quality, support people to achieve their aspirations, are efficient to manage and are future proof.

Additional information: The Learning Disability Housing Strategy will apply to the borough as a whole but its focus will primarily be on improving or replacing Royal Greenwich's directly managed provision and those premises within the large block contract that the Council holds with an external provider. It will also address the current under supply of accommodation-based services in the borough.
Our preferred partner will have a demonstrated track record of delivering housing solutions for people with a disability and of putting service users at the centre of service planning and design. In addition, they will be required to demonstrate how the project will benefit the wider local community, i.e. what social value they will add through their management of the contract.  (Examples might include community engagement programmes, investment in the social care workforce and the reinvestment of surpluses for the benefit of service users.)  In particular the provider will demonstrate how the project can offer opportunities to the Directorate's wider service user base to: 
-	promote health and wellbeing, 
-	develop independence and build self-resilience and 
-	prevent, reduce or delay the need for social care.  
.
The contract will be for four years with an option to extend for up to a maximum of three years. The value of the contract will be in the region of £150,000 per annum.",2016-06-15T13:18:56+01:00,complete,CPV,72224000,"Project management consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,London,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,,600000,GBP,,,,,,,,,,,1050000,GBP,selective,1,"Accelerated restricted procedure",2016-07-06T23:59:59+01:00,2016-08-15T00:00:00+01:00,2020-08-14T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-LAE-GRE,"Royal Borough Of Greenwich","Royal Borough Of Greenwich",GB-LAE,GRE,"3rd Floor, Woolwich Centre, 35 Wellington St.,, Woolwich,",London,"SE18 6HQ",England,"William Jabang",procurement@royalgreenwich.gov.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-45179,"Golden lane Housing Limited","Golden lane Housing Limited","123 Golden lane, London, EC1Y 0RT",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-LAE-GRE,"Royal Borough Of Greenwich",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ocds-b5fd17-c88b3ef2-adc9-11e6-9901-0019b9f3037b-1,active,2016-11-01T00:00:00Z,2017-01-19T11:41:36Z,1087672,GBP,GB-CFS-45179,"Golden lane Housing Limited",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2016-11-02T00:00:00Z,2020-11-01T23:59:59Z,,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/5719dd07-352a-4b29-9855-71f292d396d8,2017-01-19T11:41:36Z,text/html,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recognise that our current model of service delivery is not sustainable – demand for health and care services is growing as our population lives longer and we know that the cost of meeting this demand is rising more quickly than we can afford.  Patients, and in particular those with long term conditions, often find their experience of care disjointed and uncoordinated. 
Looking to the future in Horsham & Mid Sussex we know we will have a larger population and one that is living longer with complex needs. At the same time locally our general practices and community services are increasingly struggling to meet the current demands.

Our aim is to deliver a new model of care that addresses the three ‘gaps’ identified in the Five Year Forward View and delivers high quality, accessible care to our population, moving from a service that is primarily reactive and bed based, to one that focuses on keeping people well and treating them proactively in the community when they do become ill and which that results in better health and wellbeing for local people and better value for money from health and social care services.

This includes investigating, publishing reports and giving advice to the Secretary of State on whether and at what cost it is meeting the objectives of the current Road Investment Strategy (RIS).
The RIS Investment Plan sets out the details of capital investment that Highways England must deliver over the first road period (April 2015 to March 2020). Highways England has been allowed funding of £3.7 billion to deliver its programme of asset maintenance and renewals (M&R), to ensure the Strategic Road Network (SRN) is maintained in a safe and serviceable condition. 
Highways England sets out its high level plans for the volumes and costs of M&R work in its Delivery Plan, and its subsequent updates. Highways England provides, on a regular basis, progress reports of M&R delivery including a summary of expenditure against budget, renewals volumes and asset inventory and condition information.
The SRN assets fall into five main categories: pavement, structures, geotechnical, drainage and technology. This study focuses on pavement and structures.
A key part of ORR’s monitoring is to understand Highways England’s delivery of the Investment Plan, including whether it is adopting a sustainable approach to maintaining and renewing its assets.
The purpose of this project is to assess Highways England’s development and delivery of sustainable and efficient asset interventions by carrying out in-depth reviews of M&R delivery, on an asset by asset basis. 
We are carrying out this work in collaboration with Highways England.
