The key purpose of this work is to better understand the features of this dynamic sector, what it needs to grow and its performance to date. This follows a comprehensive review of the finance market for public service mutuals, after analysis of 71 mutuals, Soft Finance, Hard Choices (Boston Consulting Group, 2013), which is available online here (see attached documents for link). 

This will support the Government’s development of a strategy to deliver its commitment to support an increase in public service mutuals and live public service mutuals to be long-term sustainable organisations able to grow and compete for new contracts.

The Framework will be used in delivering the Newlon’s Development Programme (‘The Programme’).
Newlon Housing Trust has an Affordable Housing Growth Target of 2000 dwellings to be constructed by the year 2022, including Affordable Rent, Shared Ownership, Intermediate Rent and Supported and specialist housing. 
This will be augmented by the development of market rent and private sale housing. The Programme will be delivered within London, the Southeast and the East of England, including but not limited to the following London boroughs: Islington, Hackney, 	Tower Hamlet, Redbridge, Camden, Haringey, Newham, Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Enfield, Waltham Forest and	Havering.
Newlon Housing Trust will also pursue Stock Transfer and Estate Regeneration opportunities to further augment its Growth Strategy.
It is estimated that contracts with a total value of £50M - £200M will be let within the term of the Framework. The value of works contracts to be awarded through this Framework has been based on limited knowledge of expected and potential schemes and projects. These have not yet been planned to a detailed level, and therefore identifying how these contracts will be split across the Lots is not possible at this point. 
The Procurement exercise will be divided into Lots as set out below (according to the size of the proposed development project at acquisition stage):

Lot 1: approximate single contract value (works):  £2.5m-10m
Lot 2: approximate single contract value (works): £10m-25m
Lot 3: approximate single contract value (works): +£25m

This project will help inform organisational design considerations. There is already a significant body of literature on best practice in the design of organisations and their governance. BIS would like to commission a comprehensive review of this evidence.  There are also numerous examples, in the public and private sectors, nationally and internationally, of complex organisations and this work should include an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of these models. 
The focus will be on understanding best practice in organisational design and governance. This research will contribute to the evidence base that will inform the establishment of the new research body and ensure that it is structured in such a way as to be credible, accountable and effective. This project will not design the new body, rather it will synthesise existing research and collect and analyse international and national examples to identify and report on the strengths and weaknesses of different organisational and governance models. 
The project has three core aims. 
1.	To bring together and synthesise the existing literature and evidence supporting best practice in establishing strong and accountable organisations and governance structures. The focus will be on public sector organisations, particularly funding bodies, and will look at both national and international evidence. 
2.	To explore and review the strengths and weaknesses of different organisational models for distributing research funding internationally. As part of the project you will assess and recommend a core of countries/organisations where this work will focus.
3.	To learn from and anchor the analysis in the UK context by using corporate  private sector experience and regulatory framework to inform the assessment of strengths, weaknesses and best practice.",,complete,CPV,73200000,"Research and development consultancy services",CPV,79300000,"Market and economic research; polling and statistics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,London,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,79811.5,GBP,,"Other - ",2016-02-16T23:59:59Z,2016-03-08T00:00:00Z,2016-07-31T23:59:59+01:00,,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED","UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"North Star House, North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,"Kerry Hammond",research@uksbs.co.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-37826,"RAND Europe Community Interest Company","RAND Europe Community Interest Company","Westbrook Centre

MEDICAL COVER FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES

Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust would like to invite expressions of interest from Suitably Qualified Providers willing to work with the Trust to provide medical cover for the community services in development within the new Integrated Care Organisation.  
We will have a strong preference for entering into commercial-type contracts with groups of practices or federations that can bring resilience and reliability to the services that we provide together.  However we are well aware of the complexities of present cover arrangements and we will work with Individuals or Practices to consider how those arrangements can be converted into new working relationships.  

Because of the value of the potential contracts we will need to pay due heed to procurement regulations.  Where long-term contracts are to be awarded this will require a competitive process, though the importance of Torbay and South Devon Practices providing the service linkage and integration will be paramount in our assessment of any bids.
If you are interested in providing services as described and receiving further information, please make contact by registering on our e-procurement portal - EU Supply at your earliest convenience. Web link https://uk.eu-supply.com/login.asp?B=NHSSW 

When this registration is complete please follow the above link again and click on ‘current tender opportunities’ and search for RFT 25357 to register your interest.   This will ensure 

you will be included in all further communications and developments as well as allowing you to send in any questions of clarifications about the process that you may have.).

The Love Newquay Project will focus on offering digital platforms to all BID member businesses across a website and app. It will enable businesses to communicate with customers, as well as providing key demographics and analytics. Therefore, Newquay BID wants to launch a fully integrated online system to help residents, visitors and businesses get the most from their Newquay experience as a key step towards a ground-breaking digital high street experience.

MEDICAL COVER FOR COMMUNITY SERVICES

Torbay and South Devon NHS Foundation Trust would like to invite expressions of interest from Suitably Qualified Providers willing to work with the Trust to provide medical cover for the community services in development within the new Integrated Care Organisation.  
We will have a strong preference for entering into commercial-type contracts with groups of practices or federations that can bring resilience and reliability to the services that we provide together.  However we are well aware of the complexities of present cover arrangements and we will work with Individuals or Practices to consider how those arrangements can be converted into new working relationships.  

Because of the value of the potential contracts we will need to pay due heed to procurement regulations.  Where long-term contracts are to be awarded this will require a competitive process, though the importance of Torbay and South Devon Practices providing the service linkage and integration will be paramount in our assessment of any bids.
If you are interested in providing services as described and receiving further information, please make contact by registering on our e-procurement portal - EU Supply at your earliest convenience. Web link https://uk.eu-supply.com/login.asp?B=NHSSW 

When this registration is complete please follow the above link again and click on ‘current tender opportunities’ and search for RFT 25357 to register your interest.   This will ensure 

you will be included in all further communications and developments as well as allowing you to send in any questions of clarifications about the process that you may have.).

Cefas, in partnership with the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and Natural England (NE), are undertaking a multidisciplinary offshore survey on board RV Cefas Endeavour. This survey is in support of DEFRAs data gathering exercise to support the ongoing monitoring of The UK’s offshore Marine Protected Areas network and aims to collect a mix of seabed imagery, sediment samples and acoustic data from the Pisces Reef Complex SAC and Utopia MCZ. 

To support this survey Cefas are looking to hire the capacity of two on board hydrographic surveyors to calibrate the multibeam, update the SIS software, oversee acquisition, and process multibeam bathymetry/ backscatter data from a Kongsberg EM2040 system. The surveyor must be competent in using SIS for acquisition, CARIS HIPS and FMGT and be available on board the Cefas Endeavour MCZ survey in October 2016. Other survey staff will be available to acquire these data and make the raw files available for processing. However, the hydrographic surveyors must be capable of overseeing acquisition

1)	Going beyond displaced workers in general; the role of different economic conditions, sectors, locations and the characteristics of displaced workers themselves. 
The current research on income losses for displaced workers within the UK focuses on workers in general prior to 2007 that faced redundancy due to firm closure and mass-layoffs. However, if it is deemed appropriate for the government to intervene into a market of displaced workers it is essential that any intervention is designed to support workers in the best possible way.  To ensure that the government are able to do this effectively we would like to commission:
a)	An up-to-date study of the income losses of displaced workers; unpacking the distinction between pay and employment and including the most recent expansion, peak, ""Great Recession"" and recovery periods;
b)	A deeper understanding of how these income losses vary according to circumstances and personal characteristics. We are interested in characteristics such as age, skill level, job tenure, occupation, initial salary, sector and - importantly - location.
c)	An understanding of how income losses are influenced by spatial and temporal interdependencies i.e. what is the additional impact of a series of redundancies/lay-offs occurring in the same labour market area around the same time?

2)	Considering the alternative losses that displaced workers face rather than analysis solely focussing on income losses. 

The additional evidence gaps which we are interested in investigating include:
a)	The sector and occupation of future employment – what can we learn about the transferability of skills for different types of workers? 
b)	The location of future employment – what can we learn about the spatial mobility of displaced workers? And;
c)	The wider social impacts on a household containing a displaced worker such as relocation, relationship breakdown and changes in savings & health trends. The societal impacts on a household, however, are a secondary focus of the research and should be viewed as an addition to the main commission.

We would like to commission an in-depth study which analyses the points outlined above, in order to help tailor local and national policy designed to support displaced workers.",,complete,CPV,79300000,"Market and economic research; polling and statistics",CPV,73200000,"Research and development consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,London,"United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,96950,GBP,,"Other - ",2016-06-27T23:59:59+01:00,2016-07-18T00:00:00+01:00,2016-10-31T23:59:59Z,1,,services,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED","UK SHARED BUSINESS SERVICES LIMITED",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/dXGP288m,"North Star House, North Star Avenue",Swindon,"SN2 1FF",England,"Kerry Hammond",Research@uksbs.co.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-36018,"Frontier Economics","Frontier Economics","71 High Holborn
