Local Land Charges records, currently maintained by each individual Local Authority, are statutory, historic and fairly static, containing records of property charges which currently exist (e.g. tree preservation orders, listed building status).
Currently, each of the 326 Local Authorities across England have their own processes for maintaining a register of the existence of the Local Land Charges that affect land and property within their jurisdiction. These ‘notice’ registers are made up of paper records, microfiche, digital records, or a hybrid of record types.
This updated Prior Information Notice (the original one was published on 30 June 2015) is to highlight to the market that Land Registry intends, over the next 12 months, to be procuring services in the following areas:
1.	Quality Assurance Partner (Lot 1 in II.2)

The Quality Assurance Partner will assist Land Registry with implementing the independent Quality Assurance of data generation and migration preparations in accordance with Local Land Charges Data Digitisation Strategy and Standards

2.	Digitisation and Migration Partners (Lot 2 in II.2) 
Digitisation of existing Local Land Charges records from all Local Authorities (be they paper, microfiche, digital or hybrid) for migration to the Local Land Charges Register. It is possible that, due to the size, scope, and complexity of this work, consideration may be given to the establishment of a framework agreement.

3.	The following information is for completeness and background information only as these requirements will not be subject to calls for competition for reasons described.
•	Local Land Charges Register and Hosting for the Register. In addition to these 2 lots, Land Registry are building the Local Land Charges Register in house using an Alpha, Beta build approach. The in house team will be augmented, where required, by procuring resources from an existing UK Government framework. The hosting requirements for the Registry will also be procured from an existing UK Government framework.
•	Planning Delivery Partner. Following the PIN issued on 30 June 2015 this procurement has been completed through an open procedure. Subject to approvals the contract is anticipated to be awarded in August 2016. The Planning Delivery Partner will support Land Registry throughout the programme, bringing in capacity and capability across a range of important disciplines, including Programme management (including Delivery Milestones, overall delivery performance reporting and programme resourcing resilience), Supplier management, Procurement, Financial management, and the Provision of specialist Local Land Charges advice and support with the Local Land Charges Interim and Full Business Cases.

New construction of swimming pool, Multipurpose use room, gym and changing facilities. Refurbishment of remaining structures including sports hall and new wheeled sports area. The existing services installations are to be renewed and are likely to include a PV array on the roof of the sports hall and biomass boilers.

The existing facility will be closed before works commence. There is no intention to include a phased handover of the works.

The forecast construction value of the project is £7.0m and the required construction completion date is January 2018.

A Design Team have been appointed who will take the design up to RIBA Stage 3 prior to formal tender. 

The envisaged procurement route will be Single Stage Design and Build utilising the latest JCT Design and Build form of Contract. This will be confirmed on publication of the contract notice.

The requirement is for a Construction Company to be selected, appointed and to enter into contract with Wiltshire Council to work with the council’s representatives and the current Design Team who will be novated across to the successful contractor to complete the Technical Design and to construct and handover the completed facility by the end of January 2018.

This Prior Information Notice (PIN) is not a call for competition for the purposes of Regulation 26(9) of the Public Contracts regulation 2015 — a specific call for competition for this planned procurement is likely be published by means of a contract notice in or around August 2016.

The purpose of this PIN is an early notification to the market of the Council’s intention to publish a contract notice for these services in the next few months. It is anticipated that contract will be awarded to the successful construction contractor in Autumn 2016 with services to commence immediately after and completion by the end of January 2018.

This PIN is also to advise the market of a potential market engagement event which will be confirmed on publication of the contract notice.

Following this PIN and the receipt of Expressions of Interest, it is currently the intention of the Council to follow the Restricted Procedure route under the Public Contract Regulations (aka PCR) 2015 for the appointment of the Contractor either via traditional or Design and Build.

There are no procurement documents to be completed at this time. Organisations that express interest in this PIN will be automatically contacted when the tender documents are released.

Early Market Engagement 
Wiltshire council may seek to engage with potential contractors in an early market engagement event. If this is to take place, details will be included in the contract notice

About UK Shared Business Services 
Putting the business into shared services
UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise.
It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector.

Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. 

Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams.
UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It’s what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre. What is more, being a not-for-profit organisation owned by its customers, UK SBS’ goals are aligned with the public sector and delivering best value for the UK taxpayer.
UK Shared Business Services Ltd changed its name from RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd in March 2013.
Our Customers
Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Service (CSS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.
UK SBS currently manages £700m expenditure for its Customers, our growth projections anticipate this will rise to £1bn in 2013/14. 
Important information

From the 2nd April 2014 the Government is introducing its new Government Security Classifications (GSC) classification scheme to replace the current Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). A key aspect of this is the reduction in the number of security classifications used. All potential suppliers should make themselves aware of the changes as it may impact on this Requirement. The link below to the Gov.uk website provides information on the new GSC:

Named Social Workers Local Area Pilot & Supported Self-Assessment Pilot","This notice relates to two potential requirements 1) My Social Worker Pilot 2) Supported Self-Assessment Pilot. This notice is intended to provide interested suppliers with the opportunity to gain an understanding of a potential Department of Health (DH) requirement. The attached documents are therefore draft and for information only, may change and may not fully reflect any eventual final versions.

1) My Social Worker. Named Social Workers Local Area Pilot For People With Learning Disabilities, Autism and Mental Health Conditions.

The Department of Health may ultimately seek tenders for the provision of a service to work nationally with a range of local areas as pilot sites to design and test an effective operating model for Named Social Workers for people with learning disabilities or autism who may have mental health conditions. This will require Local Areas, with support from the successful organisation to innovate and test in practice key elements including the role, intended recipients, required support, processes, outputs and outcomes. A supplier information day has been arranged for Wednesday 20th July, details on how to attend the day are provided below.

2) Supported Self-Assessment and Planning Pilots. The Department of Health may ultimately seek tenders for the provision of a service to work with a range of local areas as pilot sites to design and trial an effective operating model for Supported Self-Assessment and Planning Pilots. The project will monitor and co-ordinate a Supported Self-Assessment and Planning Pilot in up to 9 local authorities across England. 
The service shall provide:
• The coordination of the Pilot, and the provision of professional advice where any practical issues arise on a Pilot site;
• Project support within each individual local authority involved in the Pilot to ensure they have enough resource to establish and run the Pilot effectively.

The Department intends to hold a supplier engagement event on Wednesday 20th July 2016 in London for both requirements. This will involve a two-way group discussion including presentations and Q&A sessions before individual briefings are held on a one to one basis via telephone conference calls (where suppliers are unable to attend) or face to face meetings. The date and time slots will be confirmed in due course. All service providers should register their interest in attending the briefing by emailing: garry.raisbeck@dh.gsi.gov.uk no later than Wednesday 13th July 2016, providing:
1. company and contact details of the person(s) wishing to attend;
2. a single paragraph summary of your organisation's experience including whether you are a Small to Medium Enterprise (SME).
Notes of the day including all questions and answers will be made available for those who are unable to attend or dial into a briefing.

The current contract for Dermatology serving the population of North East Essex will expire on 30th June 2017.  It is the CCG’s intention to tender  this service. An indicative procurement timetable will be provided during the event, however, we anticipate the new service would commence on 1st July 2017 and would be for a duration of 5years 9months.

North East Essex CCG  is taking the opportunity to review the current service specification with a view to making service improvements which will be informed by engagement with service users and providers.

The CCG also believes that market engagement is essential to inform our market knowledge, the opportunities for service integration and indeed the rationale for decisions as to the most appropriate route to market. 

The Market Engagement event will provide a further opportunity to consult with stakeholders and for prospective service providers to:-

 • Learn more about Dermatology services in North East Essex 
• Share information about services that they are able to provide or develop.

The format of the event will be a Presentation from the CCG followed by a 30-minute Q & A session. Following the Presentation, we are keen to make available individual 20-minute 1-to-1 slots with interested potential providers to answer more detailed questions and capture feedback and innovative concepts. The information gathered will be used to inform the CCG’s service model for Dermatology services and future procurement plan.


The event will be held on Monday 25th July 2016, from 9.30 am at Aspen House, Stephenson Road, Severalls Business Park, Colchester, CO4 9QR. Refreshments will be available from 9.00 am

If you wish to participate in this Pre-Tender market engagement event, please complete and e-mail the attached booking form to anthonywest2@nhs.net by 2pm on Thursday 21st July 2016.  

Please ensure that you confirm within the booking form whether or not you are interested in an individual 1-to-1 slot with the Commissioners.

Therefore, the CCGs are commissioning a Community Minor Eye Conditions Service and are looking for interested providers of this service. The service will provide assessment and treatment in the community of a number of minor eye conditions, and includes glaucoma repeat measurement and referral refinement for patients with cataracts or suspected glaucoma. The CCGs would anticipate the service to be delivered by optometrists with clinical oversight from a consultant ophthalmologist. 
The expected activity levels for the service are 3,300 (Islington and City and Hackney figures) with an approximate annual contract value of £165,000.


Commissioners are holding a market event on Thursday 28th July from 13.15-15.00 in the Hoxton Room, St Leonard’s Hospital, Nuttall Street, N1 5LZ where there will be a short presentation about the process and the service model followed by a chance to ask questions. 

Current and interested providers of eye care in Islington and City & Hackney boroughs are invited to join the event to find out more and provide any comments on how the service can link with current hospital services. 
Action: please register for the market day by confirming your attendance to clinical.procurement@nelcsu.nhs.uk. 
Pre-market event questionnaire 
Action: all providers who interested in providing the service to fill out prior to the market event (deadline 5pm 26th July).

•	to explore the way in which third party grants have been used, 
•	to identify both positive and negative issues associated with their use, 
•	to assess how effectively they are being managed, controlled and reported in relation to their scale, risk and audit trails, 
•	to look schemes where third party grants (particularly community grants) have not been used and to explore if there were any disadvantages or missed opportunities.

The project requires design and deployment expertise to establish a cross-disciplinary team to undertake a behavioural change design approach to understand and develop user-centred solutions to improve the health and wellbeing of communities across the specific settings of housing and schools. The project also requires the set up and management of data collection sources or identification of new sources for evaluation.
Outline of key tasks/deliverables
1.	Develop a delivery plan for the proposed scope of work and according to the specified delivery timeframe. Project management of the project delivery, engaging with site working groups and the HST Project Advisory Group to lead implementation.
•	Agreement with the HST Advisory Group on project plan and scope. As part of delivery plan identify and agree critical input required from stakeholders and project management levels and resources, at both project and site specific levels.
•	 Detail core design approach to delivery including project plan.. Agree on format of reports and specific products to be produced throughout the project duration
•	Include high-level costings, resource requirements within the limits of the project  budget 

2.	Deliver phase 2 of the Healthy Steps Together initiative in which the solutions prototyped in phase 1 (detailed in table 1) are fully implemented and evaluated for wider London learning. Objectives should include:
•	Identify and set up working groups at each site to engage  local communities and key stakeholders (including borough childhood obesity leads, Borough DPHs and CCG’s) 
•	Use these working groups and behavioural insight and design expertise to fully develop ideas, that were coproduced in phase 1 to address childhood obesity, into blueprints and implement these in the local community
•	Ensure that development of ideas are, where appropriate, linked into and make best use of existing local initiatives to make sure they are most impactful
•	Ensure ideas are developed with consideration of engaging hard to reach groups
•	Alongside the implementation of the proposed solutions/ideas, fully implement and test the transferable principles developed in phase 1 (as set out in Table 2 below) against each idea to ensure solution as impactful as possible
•	Establish a robust framework for behaviour change which works and can potentially be applied to different health challenges
