The Integrated Support and Assurance Process applies to this procurement and the CCG reserves the right to take such steps as necessary to comply with this. NHS Scarborough & Ryedale CCG is part of the Capped Expenditure Process (see below) and reserves the right to take such steps as necessary to address and respond to this process.

The CCG reserves the right to:

Across the local health system there are significant financial pressures. As a result, it has not been possible to produce financial plans that meet the funding allocations for York and Scarborough. This has caused the local health community to be placed into a process known as the Capped Expenditure Process (CEP), a national programme that includes a number of other financially challenged health communities. Further detail is contained in the PQQ.

NHS Scarborough & Ryedale CCG is working together, with NHS England and NHS Improvement, to draw up short-term financial recovery plans to improve the local financial position. At the same time, it is continuing to plan for the medium and longer term, focusing on designing better, more joined up services that will help people to stay well and reduce reliance on hospital-based care.

Bidders must submit a PQQ response. The PQQ sets out the rules of the Procurement Exercise, selection criteria & minimum requirements for selecting top 3 bidders for dialogue phase. There will be 1 round of dialogue.

Top 3 scoring bidders will be those who:

- achieve a score greater than '0' on all scored questions (except finance);
- achieve an overall score of not less than 60%;

•	Have a good understanding of the Staffordshire's health and care system and develop effective working relationships with all key stakeholders in this area 
•	Provide support and influence key stakeholders in the design and delivery of Staffordshire's health and care priorities. 
•	Ensuring there is a public voice on how services are planned, commissioned and delivered to make a difference locally.
•	Make appropriate linkages with key decision making structures, including its statutory role on the Health and Wellbeing Board and supporting the Scrutiny Committee in their work programme to do this.
•	Have a good understanding of existing networks and utilise these as appropriate to deliver Healthwatch statutory functions.     
•	Ensure close working links with Staffordshire County Council's advocacy provider(s), in helping people to make a complaint about a local health service independent of the NHS.  

The estimated annual budget could be up to £210,000 per annum.

We actively engage and support prospective international students with our overseas activities, directly or through third party agents.

Whilst very successful with student recruitment to date, we are continuously looking to improve our engagement and support, always aiming to provide the best student experience from their first contact with us. We in addition continue to review our ways of working to find more effective and efficient methods, enhancing the service we provide through utilising accessible software solutions 

Systems
Whilst without a CRM solution for student recruitment at present, we do fully utilise Tribal SITS to support application management and plan to continue to do so. The solution procured through this opportunity will need to be fully linked to the Tribal SITS installation and provide a means to connect with other systems also, potentially utilising an integration layer.

We are looking for a system to support us in the following areas, with Enquiry management a primary focus.
o	Enquiry Management. Enquiries capture (from Home/EU and International prospective students relating to UG, PGT (Post Graduate Taught) and PGR (Post Graduate Research programmes), processing and oversight/workflow
•	Enquiries capture from a variety of sources
•	Enquiries response (timely, informative, consistent and appropriate)
•	Enquiries oversight and workflow

o	Recruitment Relationship management (Home/EU/International, UG, PGT and PGR) and Outreach & widening participation support
•	Engagement with enquirers to maintain contact and interest in the University
•	Linking with SITS information, engaging with applicants and offer holders, supporting them through to registration and enrolment
•	Track prospective students interactions with the University at various touchpoints
•	Capture contacts information related to Outreach and WP activities

o	Recruitment Communications, Marketing and Event management support
•	Campaigns
•	Support for events (Open days and Offer Holder Visit Days)
•	Targeted, tailored marketing and engagement

o	Reporting and Market Research
•	Flexible reporting
•	Analysis and interrogation of information held",2016-12-05T14:05:58Z,complete,CPV,48445000,"Customer Relation Management software package",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,"South West","United Kingdom",,,,,,,,,,,,950000,GBP,1250000,GBP,selective,"Competitive dialog",2017-01-20T23:59:59Z,2017-06-05T00:00:00+01:00,2024-06-04T23:59:59+01:00,1,,goods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/xTJy93Ss,"UNIVERSITY OF EXETER","UNIVERSITY OF EXETER",GB-SRS,sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/xTJy93Ss,"Northcote House, Queens Drive",Exeter,"EX4 4QJ",England,,procurement@exeter.ac.uk,,,buyer,GB-CFS-62084,"Pythagoras Communications Limited","Pythagoras Communications Limited","Ashwood House, Grove Business Park, Waltham Road, Berkshire.",large,,supplier,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-SRS-sid4gov.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/xTJy93Ss,"UNIVERSITY OF EXETER",,ocds-b5fd17-9efa3cf4-1a34-4ff4-a79d-3726ce92d78c-1,active,2017-06-13T00:00:00+01:00,2017-07-17T14:43:55+01:00,758403,GBP,GB-CFS-62084,"Pythagoras Communications Limited",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017-06-14T00:00:00+01:00,2022-08-31T23:59:59+01:00,,1,awardNotice,"Awarded contract notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/9bf0f764-ca6c-4c65-9d14-0c7fc566692d,2017-07-17T14:43:55+01:00,text/html,en,2,tenderNotice,"Electronic Tender Portal",https://in-tendhost.co.uk/universityofexeter/aspx/Home,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CCG wishes to commission an IAPT service for Croydon residents ensuring a safe, high quality and innovative service provision across the London Borough of Croydon, in line with the CCG's strategic vision.  

The Croydon vision for an integrated IAPT service is one where all sections of the community are equally able to access the service; this will include communities which may be described as hard to reach. The service will maximise and ensure strong and effective links with physical health services to support people with, for example, long term conditions and medically unexplained symptoms where talking therapy may support better health outcomes. This will include links with pain management services to create a whole care pathway.
The CCG is looking for a single integrated service contract for the whole of the requirement.  In light of the CCG's knowledge of and engagement with current providers and the wider market, it is recognised that this may be delivered through an alliance based model with a lead provider working alongside smaller, more specialised service providers, particularly where patient and stakeholder engagement has often identified a preference for non-statutory providers including from BAME communities.
The service model should be innovative and developed with regard to increasing access rates beyond the minimum specified by the CCG for each year of the contract using the provider's expertise in delivering waiting times and recovery rates within the service model, but within the constraints of the financial envelope available for each year of the contract.

Improving access to psychological therapies is a national programme to increase the availability of 'talking therapies' on the NHS.

IAPT is primarily for people who have mild to moderate mental health difficulties, such as depression, anxiety, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. These conditions are treated using a variety of therapeutic techniques, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT) and couples therapy. 

IAPT seeks to use the least intrusive method of care possible to treat people. This is often called a 'stepped care model' and means that the patient is generally offered a low intensity therapy in the first instance. This can include computerised CBT (cCBT) and guided self-help. If low intensity treatments are unsuccessful or inappropriate the patient will be 'stepped up' to high intensity. This often takes the form of one on one CBT.

The Croydon IAPT service is expected to increase the number of people accessing the service year on year in order that services move closer to compliance with the targets set out in the NSHE 5year Forward View, that by 2020/21 there will be increased access to psychological therapies so that at least 25% of people with common mental health conditions can access services each year.

Additional information: NHS Croydon Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) is hosting a Bidder Briefing event for prospective bidders for the provision of IAPT services in Croydon.
The bidder briefing will provide interested organisations with an overview of the proposed new services and the CCGs requirements and desired outcomes. There will also be an overview of the procurement process and the opportunity to network with other providers.
The briefing will take place from 2pm on 25th July 2017. The briefing will be held at the following location:
Croydon Conference Centre, Surrey House, 5-9 Surrey St, Croydon CR0 1RG


The contract to be awarded will be for an initial 3 years with the service expected to commence from 1st April 2018, with an option of up to a further 2 years subject to agreement.

This included but was not limited to City Works Depot, Copper recycling and wire stripping plant, vehicle repair, maintenance and servicing garage, canteen, radiator servicing, public gym and storage area for various other companies.
      It was also the location of the Norwich City Councils Property Services Office before being demolished in 2015. Previous commercial uses also include - A sawmill, blacksmiths and paint spraying company.
      Norwich City Council has started to look into the potential disposal or regeneration of the site, however, due to the continued change in its use over the years Norwich City Council needs absolute confirmation and guarantee that the site is ""safe"" for regeneration as detailed in Appendix L if either option is taken. Within the last 12 months, Norwich City Council commissioned a geotechnical site investigation / feasibility investigations into the potential disposal of or regeneration of the site. Please see Appendix L for details of the investigation, its findings and recommendations.
      An intrusive investigation report was commissioned with Harrisons Geotechnical Engineering Ltd. The report highlighted a number of hazardous vapours, contaminated soil, including asbestos from its previous and current uses. It is considered necessary to provide a more detailed investigation.
      Asbestos containing material throughout the site will need to be identified and clearly itemised by a suitably qualified individual before any potential commercial or residential development can be considered. 
      The full specification is detailed on Appendix J  contained in this advertisement.

The tennis operator will be expected to deliver a fully inclusive community programme, comprising tennis activities for all ages and abilities as well as delivering to specific target groups identified by the local authority.  Another key objective of the role will be to drive interest in pay and play tennis, through the implementation of a marketing plan to ensure the long-term sustainability of the tennis operation.

The Council is currently working in partnership with the LTA to significantly improve the current tennis facilities (9 outdoor courts), through the addition of 3 new courts, floodlighting to 6 courts and the building of a new clubhouse. This development will also include the installation of an electronic court access system linked to online court booking, which will provide easy access and affordable tennis for the local community.
The operator will be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the tennis activities, including the delivery of a comprehensive tennis programme.

This is a really exciting opportunity to manage and be part of one of the largest community tennis facilities in the UK. The current population of the Borough is approximately 160,00 and within the next ten years WBC will have an additional 10,500 homes.

This work package (WP1) is part of project T995 - Development of a new locomotive gauge, which includes two Work Packages: T995-01 Revise and refine current locomotive gauge in GERT8073 Appendix N  and T995-02 External Technical Expertise.
This project T995 - Development of a new locomotive gauge has two work packages:

•	Work Package 01- Revise and refine current locomotive gauge in GERT8073 Appendix N (described in this document)

•	Work Package 02 - External Technical Expertise

This project follows on from previous projects to develop standard vehicle gauges, namely T977 - Development of a revised lower sector vehicle gauge  and T978 Development of Passenger Standard Vehicle Gauges PG1 (20m) and PG2 (23m), which have already been delivered.  

This research workstream supports the Vehicle/ Structure System Interface Committee's (V/S SIC's) long term Gauging strategy which aims to:

a)	Maximise Capacity on Great Britain's Rail Network by adopting European size gauges/ vehicles over a core, nationwide network;

b)	Define and implement standard infrastructure and vehicle gauges and provide an optimised Customer experience at the Platform Train Interface;

c)	Lower Costs of gauging to the industry;

d)	Contribute to Great Britain's reduction in Carbon emissions through modal shift. 

This particular project (T995) looks at refining the current locomotive gauge so that it can be applied for both sides of the vehicle to infrastructure interface. The aim of the research is to have a matched loco/ infrastructure/ lower sector gauge family that will go 'nearly everywhere' with clear understanding and agreement of where a resultant compliant locomotive will not go and what the consequences/ costs/ benefits are of the resultant exception list of sites where the locomotive gauge has sub-standard clearance.",2017-05-15T09:50:53+01:00,active,CPV,73000000,"Research and development services and related consultancy services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"EC2M 2RB",,,,,,,,,,,65000,GBP,75000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2017-07-21T23:59:59+01:00,2017-08-21T00:00:00+01:00,2018-08-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,,services,1,tenderNotice,"Opportunity notice on Contracts Finder",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/5f493880-b9e2-46d1-ae85-3743126f3ae8,2017-07-17T10:42:12+01:00,,text/html,en,3,biddingDocuments,"RSSB 2593 -  T995 -01 - Research&Development  Terms & Conditions",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/f04c267f-a916-4520-908e-8f934d8443c0,application/msword,4,biddingDocuments,"Commercial Pricing Schedule",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/be2dd968-a803-425b-b2d9-3380f093343b,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet,7,tenderNotice,2014-report-t978-development-suburban-gauge-23m-variant-summary,https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/10d77875-3885-4879-8d10-dedd42648cc2,application/pdf,8,biddingDocuments,"RSSB2593 - T995 -01 - I.T.T -4th July",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/7593fb74-8645-4161-89c2-2ab5c69fe3b7,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,9,biddingDocuments,"RSSB2593 - T995 -01  - Tender Question and Answer Document - 4th July",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/fc1a55ce-de3a-4654-ac6a-108c6634eb58,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,10,tenderNotice,"RSSB2593 - T995 -01  - Tender Question and Answer Document - 17th  July",https://www.contractsfinder.service.gov.uk/Notice/Attachment/150693b0-7338-46ea-b6e4-7b011356d260,application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document,GB-GOR-OT1207,"RAIL SAFETY AND STANDARDS BOARD LIMITED","RAIL SAFETY AND STANDARDS BOARD LIMITED",GB-GOR,OT1207,"The Helicon",London,"EC2M 2RB",England,"R&D Business Partner",shareditt@rssb.co.uk,,,buyer,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-GOR-OT1207,"RAIL SAFETY AND STANDARDS BOARD LIMITED",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

      The University have consistently been at the cutting edge of building redevelopment and refurbishments and have won a number of industry awards in recognition of our work within these areas.  A key element to both the design and operation of these successful building projects is the selection of appropriate furniture, fixtures and appropriate equipment.

Demand for this facility is expected to continue to rise. It is important to meet this demand and to empower front line investigators to carry out these examinations 24/7. This will ensure that:
•	The minimum number of suspects have to be bailed pending the examination of their mobile devices and that when it is necessary, the duration of their bail is minimised;
•	Victims and witnesses are not unduly inconvenienced when it is necessary to examine their mobile devices; 
•	Turnaround times for examination of mobile devices is significantly reduced; and
•	Submissions to the e-Forensics unit are reduced, enabling skilled staff to focus on more complex technical examinations.

The vision for Cheshire Constabulary is that frontline investigators will have access to mobile device examination equipment at a number of local sites including Custody Suites, Local Police Stations and Headquarters. A number of trained frontline investigators will carry out mobile device examinations on behalf of their colleagues.  
  
These trained frontline investigators will advise colleagues on what information may be obtained from mobile devices, how to preserve the evidence and how to use it to develop lines of enquiry. This will ensure that:
•	Wasteful examinations will be prevented by a formalised decision-making process that also ensures force-wide consistency;
•	There will be strong governance of the equipment and procedures, with an operational manager who is accountable for sustaining and promoting the proper use of the equipment; and
•	This vision is consistent with the Police & Crime Plan Priority of ""building on the use of innovative technology to deliver better services to the communities of Cheshire"".",,complete,CPV,30200000,"Computer equipment and supplies",CPV,31640000,"Machines and apparatus with individual functions",CPV,32500000,"Telecommunications equipment and supplies",CPV,38000000,"Laboratory, optical and precision equipments (excl. glasses)",CPV,72610000,"Computer support services",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1,,,"CW7 2UA",,"British Oversea Territories",,"Channel Islands",,Europe,,"Isle of Man","Rest of the World","United Kingdom",50000,GBP,200000,GBP,open,"Open procedure",2017-01-16T23:59:59Z,2017-04-03T00:00:00+01:00,2019-03-31T23:59:59+01:00,1,,goods,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,GB-CFS-18939,"Cheshire Constabulary on behalf of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire","Cheshire Constabulary on behalf of the Police and Crime Commissioner for Cheshire",,,"Headquarters, Clemonds Hey, Oakmere Road,","Winsford,Cheshire","CW7 2UA",ENG,"Jacqui Williams",jacqui.williams@cheshire.pnn.police.uk,"+44 1606363016",http://www.cheshire.police.uk,buyer,GB-CFS-62015,"MICRO SYSTEMATION LTD (MSAB)","MICRO SYSTEMATION LTD (MSAB)","The Ashridge Business Centre
