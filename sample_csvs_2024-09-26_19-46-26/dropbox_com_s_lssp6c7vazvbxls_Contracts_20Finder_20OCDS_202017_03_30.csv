TED Reference 2016/S 220-401969

The STFC Newton Agri-Tech Fund is a 5-year programme with a budget of £13.5M. This initiative uses the UK's expertise in remote sensing and modelling in the area of agricultural technology (agri-tech) to work with and aid the Chinese farming community. The Agri-Tech programme will use the breakthroughs in satellite imaging, remote sensing and modelling to which they are helping to provide facilities and technologies that are supporting research driven, decision making tools for farmers and policy makers. STFC are seeking to secure Impact and Technical Team advice and support with the aim of ensuring the impact of the research in the area of agricultural technology to China. The Impact and Technical team will plan and be responsible for the delivery of a strategic programme of work to support and improve agricultural technology in China.
The over-arching strategic direction for the design of a coherent programme of activities designed to achieve three key deliverables:
- Establish and/or enhance a strong international profile for the research generated through the programme and projects.
- Build a reputation for the programme as centres of agricultural technology research and excellence in international development.
- Ensure findings from the programme's research are effectively cohered, disseminated and utilised by policy makers and users, particularly in China.
The successful bidder will be responsible for the successful delivery of this strategically-directed programme of activities. They will take the lead role in ensuring delivery of programme-level communications and the production, dissemination and delivery of appropriate knowledge products and activities. It will also build upon relevant activities being undertaken at individual grant level by maintaining oversight, facilitating, supporting and building capacity in relation to these.
Excluded: Impact and Technical Team will not play any part in decisions of academic substance in relation to the programme/projects or their intellectual leadership and future direction, or play any part in the awarding of research funding, other than providing strategic advice on ensuring policymaker and user demand is appropriately integrated.

      Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council covers 9796 hectares with approximately 316,000 residents and 880km of public highways.
      The problem of illegally grazed and stray horses has been endemic within the whole of the Black Country for decades. It has been the practice of horse owners to tether or just leave their animals on parks, football pitches, nature reserves and other open land. The tethering of horses is not prohibited by law, but is unauthorised on Council Land.
      This results in a range of problems including; direct damage to land, loss of amenities such as football pitches, planted and wooded areas being destroyed and potential injury to the public or motorists. In addition to the health and safety problems, stray and tethered horses cause nuisance and result in a considerable volume of complaints from the public which are directed at both the Council and the police.
      The Council is keen to establish a robust and long term arrangement by appointing a contractor to address both the issue of planned enforcement activity and a comprehensive reactive response service to collect stray horses from the highway via a tendering process.

In order to improve support to Adult Social Care service users through its AT service, KMBC is seeking to have a better understanding of the range of equipment available to take account of the most effective available technologies to help people to live independently and securely in their own home and within the community.

The Council wishes to talk to individuals and other organisations who will supply equipment, provide market knowledge and expertise and who have an awareness of the challenges facing local authority social care services.   

The Council is planning to run a market engagement exercise to discuss its plans with the market place. We therefore invite expressions of interest from anybody who believes they can help the Council to meet its objectives. 

If you wish to be involved in this market engagement process please respond by email to david.tyrrell@knowsley.gov.uk giving your company name and contact details.

The Department for Business, Industrial Strategy and Energy (BEIS) works with 47 arm's length bodies. Companies House, the Competition and Market Authority, Innovate UK, the Low Pay Commission and the Met Office are just some of the bodies that we sponsor and support.  

In our sponsor role, we help recruit individuals to various Boards, Committees and Panels, working closely with our arm's lengths bodies to ensure we attract a diverse range of candidates as vacancies arise. In any given year, we make over 100 public appointments - each of which the BEIS Secretary of State and/or his Ministers approve. 

For some appointments, we are looking for specialist skills and knowledge in a particular domain, e.g. competition law. For other appointments, we are looking for transferrable leadership skills. 

Given the breadth and depth of the appointments that we make, we need to maintain a strong and diverse 'pipeline' of talent. It is also important to support that talent to compete for existing and future roles in any number of arm's length bodies that we sponsor over time. 

To that end, we are looking to review our current 'offer' to individuals with an interest in public service.

Objectives
Our goal is to attract and retain excellent candidates, through a strong and compelling brand that can be used to market public appointments. We aim to:

•	Have a clear and compelling offer for candidates that can be used in our products to market roles to potential candidates.
•	Understand our competition in both the public and private sectors, by researching the competitive landscape and comparing BEIS against this landscape. 
•	Identify our points of differentiation (the way in which we differ from other public sector organisations) to be used to communicate to candidates the opportunities available within BEIS.
•	Ensure the opportunities on offer appeal to candidates and can provide the credibility and kudos they crave. 
•	Have a better understanding of how and where to search for potential candidates.


Deliverables
•	Undertake a Brand Review to analyse how the BEIS brand is currently performing.

•	Produce best practice guidance for future campaigns. The guidance should set out an 'exemplar' in terms of how we can attract a high quality and diverse candidates to our roles. 

•	Set out a future marketing Strategy

The units will primarily be required within Coventry but future requirements could arise that may require delivery outside of Coventry.
      
      The Framework shall be awarded for a 4 year term to cover the initial order of 10 units plus any further requirements that are identified within this term.

Additional information: The Council will be administering this opportunity via its e-tendering system, www.csw-jets.co.uk, a link to the site where the tender is advertised is below:

CEDIL is being tendered in two stages. In this second tender, DFID is seeking to appoint a Programme Directorate to manage and implement the vision and evaluation research agenda of CEDIL. This is a unique opportunity to manage and ensure the delivery of a large, high profile, international centre that will develop impact evaluation research capacity within the UK and internationally. The objective is to establish a high quality, inter-disciplinary academic centre to innovate in the field of impact evaluation ; design, commission and implement impact evaluations; and promote the uptake and use of evidence from impact evaluations. This should be delivered through a consortium consisting of the Research Director and Intellectual Leadership Team who have already been appointed through a separate tender and the Programme Directorate. The purpose of CEDIL is to drive forward the field of impact evaluation and development evaluation both theoretically and in practice. CEDIL will act as an international focal point and develop and demonstrate new and innovative methodologies for impact evaluation and evidence accumulation. The strategic direction of CEDIL will be guided by the Research Director and Intellectual leadership Team , with inputs and support from the Programme Directorate. CEDIL will promote and carry out innovative and rigorous impact evaluations to identify 'what works, for whom, in what contexts, how and when' in international development, as well as contribute to the advancement of emergent, pioneering and cutting edge methodologies for impact evaluation, in order to maximise the effectiveness of spending on international development by: • Strategically delivering high quality, systematic and rigorous evaluation of complex international development interventions, including some of DFID's interventions; • Adapting existing methodologies and pioneering new evaluation approaches and designs that draw on social, natural, biomedical science and other disciplines to advance DFID's understanding of 'what works, for whom, in what contexts, how and when' in international development; • Developing capacity in DFID, evaluation suppliers and the evaluation community more broadly so that DFID can commission robust evaluations which use the approaches and designs that have been adapted and developed, and the market has the skills to apply them; • Systematically and rigorously accumulating, modelling and analysing bodies of evidence in a manner that improves the external validity of findings and identifies where further investigation is most needed

About UK Shared Business Services 
Putting the business into shared services
UK Shared Business Services Ltd (UK SBS) brings a commercial attitude to the public sector; helping our customers improve efficiency, generate savings and modernise.
It is our vision to become the leading provider for our customers of shared business services in the UK public sector, continuously reducing cost and improving quality of business services for Government and the public sector.

Our broad range of expert services is shared by our customers. This allows our customers the freedom to focus resources on core activities; innovating and transforming their own organisations. 

Core services include Procurement, Finance, Grants Admissions, Human Resources, Payroll, ISS, and Property Asset Management all underpinned by our Service Delivery and Contact Centre teams.
UK SBS is a people rather than task focused business. It's what makes us different to the traditional transactional shared services centre. What is more, being a not-for-profit organisation owned by its customers, UK SBS' goals are aligned with the public sector and delivering best value for the UK taxpayer.
UK Shared Business Services Ltd changed its name from RCUK Shared Services Centre Ltd in March 2013.
Our Customers
Growing from a foundation of supporting the Research Councils, 2012/13 saw Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) transition their procurement to UK SBS and Crown Commercial Service (CSS - previously Government Procurement Service) agree a Memorandum of Understanding with UK SBS to deliver two major procurement categories (construction and research) across Government.
UK SBS currently manages £700m expenditure for its Customers, our growth projections anticipate this will rise to £1bn in 2013/14. 
Important information

From the 2nd April 2014 the Government is introducing its new Government Security Classifications (GSC) classification scheme to replace the current Government Protective Marking Scheme (GPMS). A key aspect of this is the reduction in the number of security classifications used. All potential suppliers should make themselves aware of the changes as it may impact on this Requirement. The link below to the Gov.uk website provides information on the new GSC:

An important element of this is the provision of a new ""crisis pad"".
The service will offer people experiencing crisis or distress access to a calm, safe, environment providing emotional and practical support/therapeutic interventions and where necessary, rapid access to a suitably qualified practitioner who can assess their needs. The service will operate outside of normal work hours. 
Aim:
	To improve support for people experiencing a mental health crisis out of usual working hours
	To support crisis resolution through brief treatment interventions and techniques that will deliver self-care
	To reduce the number of hospital admissions due to the lack of alternative support out of hours.

This will be achieved by:
Providing a facility to operate a twilight service between the hours of 2000 and 0200.  
Supporting the service with access to appropriately qualified staff who can effectively triage and signpost people/carers to the scheme through the Rapid Response Service. 
Implement skills/competency based training and support to volunteers and staff involved in delivering the service. 

The successful organisation will provide support to people experiencing a mental health crisis or distress through support staff and possibly volunteers. They will be supported by the Rapid Response Service (RRS) where required and appropriate.  All referrals will be triaged through the RRS. The crisis pad physical facility will likely be provided by the Trust; the location has yet to be identified. It will be open to people in the Hull & East Riding area.

Value of contract: in the region of 100- 120k per annum
Term: 1 year with possible extension

Additional information: The contracting authority considers that this contract may be suitable for economic operators that are small or medium enterprises (SMEs). However, any selection of tenderers will be based solely on the criteria set out for the procurement.The service transports vulnerable older people back home after a hospital stay or after contact with A & E, where it is identified that the individual requires 24 hour and or reablement assistance to prevent a hospital admission. Support is offered on an assessed needs basis for up to six weeks until they have fully settled back at home.  This helps to reduce the number of delayed discharges from Bedford Hospital and reduce referrals to high cost services such as residential care and domiciliary care packages.

TEAN's aims for teacher education are: to enhance practice; support and promote innovation and development; and contribute to and help build research capacity.
      The TEAN conference offers an opportunity for colleagues to spend time together to share great practice and ideas. In a supportive and welcoming atmosphere you will be able to share ideas with an appreciative audience who will both encourage and challenge you. The TEAN conference is held over two days and it is important to make the most of the time available to us. In prior years we have had over 180 delegates as well as guest speakers. 
      We are asking for tenderers to submit for the provision of the next 3 conferences (9th, 10th and 11th). The first conference will be the 9th annual conference to be held in May 2018.
